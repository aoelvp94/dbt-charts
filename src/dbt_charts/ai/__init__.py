"""Core AI utilities for dbt charts.

This module provides shared AI service utilities used by both Playground and Suite.
It consolidates common patterns like prompt loading, tool dispatch, and YAML extraction.

Modules:
    prompts: Prompt loading and building utilities
    tool_schemas: Canonical tool definitions (render_board, execute_query, ...)
    tools: Tool-call dispatch over those definitions
    yaml_utils: YAML extraction from AI responses
