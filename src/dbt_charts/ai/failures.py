Its own module, with no imports of its own, because both ends of the stream
need it: ``events.AgentError`` carries a member and ``llm.classify`` derives
one. Putting it in either of those would make the other import a cycle.

    One closed vocabulary for a production turn and an eval case, so an offline

    purpose: this is a Prometheus label, and a member derived from user-supplied
    text would make its cardinality unbounded.

    ``tool_error`` is deliberately absent. ``dispatch_tool_call`` converts every
    handler exception into a result envelope, so no site could set it; the
    tool-surface task adds it when it has a producer and a test.
