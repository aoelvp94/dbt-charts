"""Prompt loading and building utilities for AI services.

This module provides shared utilities for loading prompts from markdown files
and building system prompts with context.

Shared guides (design principles, workflow, etc.) live in dbt_charts/ai/skills/
as SKILL.md files — the single source of truth for all AI consumers.
App-specific prompt suffixes are allowed only for surface contracts that are
not generic Dataface behavior, such as Playground's SSE editor mirroring or
A lIe's satire persona. UI transport behavior should stay in transport code,
not in prompt suffixes.
