"""The vendored font registry: one home for every family we measure or paint.

Text width is decided twice — once here, when fontTools reads advance widths to pick
wrap points, and once in the browser, when it paints from the ``@font-face`` files this
module also names. Those two answers must come from the same glyph bytes. When they did
not, wide prose wrapped against widths narrower than it was drawn at and ran past the
nested ``<svg>`` viewport that clips it, slicing the last word off the line with no error.

So family → file lives in exactly one place: ``FONT_REGISTRY``. Measurement, the emitted
``@font-face`` CSS, and vl-convert all read it. Adding a font means adding a
row, not adding an accessor.

# always paints those from the OS color font regardless of what we subset — but
# vl-convert/resvg static exports have no such override, so a subset that still
# carries U+FE0F is what lets those glyphs pair correctly there. Kept deliberately;
