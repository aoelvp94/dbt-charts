"""Warehouse query attribution — what ran this query, and whose budget it belongs to.

Stage: leaf (no compile/execute/render dependencies).

Every query Dataface sends carries an attribution payload so a warehouse cost model
can tell a Dataface query apart from ad-hoc human querying. Without it a dashboard
render is indistinguishable from someone typing SQL into a console, and cost
attribution has to guess.

Two halves, with different owners:

- **Identity** is engine-owned and derived — the app, the surface, the board and query
  that caused the call. Authoring it would create a second source of truth that drifts
  on the first rename, so authors cannot set it. Most of it sits under the
  ``dbt_charts_`` namespace; ``app`` deliberately does not, because dbt emits
  ``app=dbt`` and sharing that one key lets a cost model ask "which tool ran this"
  once instead of per tool.
- **Ownership** (``team``, ``cost_center``, …) cannot be derived from anything the
  engine knows. It is authored per source via ``attribution:``.

The payload reaches the warehouse through ``execute/adapters/query_header.py``; this
module stays free of any dbt import so the compile layer can share its vocabulary.

Engine-owned values are *normalized* to the label charset (we generate them, so a board
slug of ``gtm/weekly-revenue`` becoming ``gtm-weekly-revenue`` is our own bookkeeping).
Authored values are *validated* and rejected — silently rewriting what an author typed
is the failure mode where a cost model quietly attributes spend to the wrong team.
