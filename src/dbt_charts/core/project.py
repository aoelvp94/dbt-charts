    - ``glob`` yields ``ProjectPath`` handles sorted by relpath; ``grep``

    - Both methods operate on PROJECT-relative paths end to end. Host-level
      path translation (e.g. a monorepo ``git_subdirectory``) must be
      invisible here — in particular it is never subject to skip filtering.
    - A pattern whose literal prefix (``glob_literal_prefix``) enters a
      ``SKIP_SCAN_DIRS`` directory yields nothing.

      be read as text (binary, vanished, over a host size cap) are skipped,
      never raised.
    - Symlink and skip-dir enumeration policy is the host's ``iter_files``
      policy; implementations do not add private per-method rules.

    Both methods are abstract by design: there is no lowest-common-denominator
    default, so a host can never silently fall through to an unoptimized full
