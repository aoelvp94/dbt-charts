"""Engine-owned predefined format vocabulary.

Every format the engine treats as a semantic name -- with house rules (notation
registers, round-aware trim, native formatters) -- lives here. Format values
from three sources:

| source          | behavior                                                  |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| enum member     | house rules: engine spec + notation register + trim       |
| style.formats   | native d3: literal spec, no post-processing               |
| inline d3 str   | native d3: literal spec, no post-processing               |

House glyphs (MINUS U+2212, NULL_DISPLAY em-dash) stay universal for ALL
format sources. They are chart typography, not format semantics -- a user alias
should not resurrect ASCII hyphen-minus in one cell of a table whose other
cells use the proper glyph.

A style.formats key equal to any ALL_PREDEFINED_NAMES member is a shadowing
violation -- the engine owns those names. Raise ERR-FORMAT-PREDEFINED-SHADOW at compile.

NULL_DISPLAY and MINUS are intentionally re-declared here rather than imported
from format_d3 to avoid a circular import (format_d3 imports PREDEFINED_NUMBER_NAMES
from this module).

    """The lower edge of the sub-$1 band in which an adaptive member avoids SI.

    Used at the call site as ``floor < abs(value) < 1.0`` -- a fixed 1.0
    ceiling, not a general adaptive band. Fixing "$13" for $12.99 needs a
    per-set vote over the whole slot (axis, column, ...) and is tracked
    separately (closed PR #7854); this predicate is the narrower per-value
    fix for amounts under a dollar, where SI is not imprecise but wrong.

    ``MONEY_SUB_UNIT_FLOOR`` (0.005) for money, which has no sub-cent unit to
    name: d3's SI ``m`` (milli) is not in the house suffix vocabulary
    (``_D3_TO_ANALYTIC`` keys are k/M/G/T/P/E/Z/Y), so it stays glued inside
    the number as "$670m" rather than lifting into the suffix lane.

    The floor is 0.005 rather than 0.0 because the fallback it swaps to is
    ``$,.2f``, which cannot represent less than half a cent: below that it
    renders "$0.00" for every row of a CPC, per-token or FX column, which is
    indistinguishable from the genuine zeros this same band is careful to
    leave as "$0". Confining the swap to the range the fallback can actually
    represent keeps sub-cent money on SI, where it is at least readable.

    ``1.0`` for a plain quantity, whose fraction the Python-painted KPI and
    table surfaces still print as an SI sub-unit -- ``0.671`` as "671m",
    d3's milli. An axis no longer does: a non-compacting tick ladder writes
    its digits out at any magnitude (``non_compacting_tick_format``,
    ``numeral_scale``), so read this arm as those surfaces' own position, not
    a shared one.

    Money is a resolved spec carrying a literal ``$``, or a prefix/suffix
    that contains a known currency symbol or spells out a major ISO 4217
    code (``_MONEY_SYMBOLS`` / ``_MONEY_CODES`` above). This is a heuristic
    over a small, explicit set -- it cannot enumerate the world's
    currencies, and it does not try to. Money detection here has two ways
    to be wrong, and only one of them is survivable: calling a real
    currency "not money" just keeps today's SI rendering (a value like
    ``0.002 kg`` printing an odd-looking ``2m kg`` is a cosmetic miss, and
    that same miscall on money is the acceptable "$13 from $12.99" case
    already tracked separately). Calling a plain quantity "money" runs it
    through the exact-two-decimal fallback and truncates it -- ``0.002 kg``
    would render as ``0.00 kg``, discarding a real value. So whenever this
    predicate cannot positively identify money, it must decline the floor
    and fall through to SI -- never the other way around.
