"""Letter-case transform dispatcher for dbt charts typography.

Applies at render time — after Jinja resolution but before the string reaches
an SVG <text> node or a Vega-Lite spec string field.

Supported values (matching FontStyle.case):
  none       — no-op; string emitted as authored / as normalized by slug_to_text.
  upper      — str.upper() (Unicode-aware).
  lower      — str.lower() (Unicode-aware).
  sentence   — first character uppercased, remainder unchanged.
               Preserves acronyms and proper nouns that the author
               already capitalized.  Does NOT lowercase the rest of the
               string — that would corrupt ARR, iOS, etc.
  title      — Chicago/Gruber algorithm via the `titlecase` library, with
               a callback that extends the small-words list (per, with,
               from, into, onto, upon, out, off, down, up) and a
               standalone-all-caps guard so single acronym slugs
               (``ARR``, ``YOY``, ``USD``, ``KPI``) survive the
               library's whole-line ``all_caps`` detection. Lowercases
               stopwords (a, an, and, as, at, but, by, en, for, if, in,
               of, on, or, the, to, v[.], vs[.], via — plus the
               extended set above). Always capitalizes first and last
               words. Preserves any token with internal capitals
               (iPhone, YoY).
  slug       — Machine identifier form: spaces/hyphens → underscore, lower.
               "Order Status" → "order_status".
  camel      — camelCase: first word lower, subsequent words capitalized.
               "order status" → "orderStatus".
