"""Registry loader — parse and validate registry YAML into typed models.

Purpose: Load a registry.yaml string (or the built-in package registry) into
         a list of validated RegisteredView instances.

Two public functions:
- load_registry_yaml(raw, include_experimental=False)  — parse a YAML string
- load_builtin_registry(include_experimental=False)    — load the shipped registry
