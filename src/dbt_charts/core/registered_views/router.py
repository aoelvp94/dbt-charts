"""Route compilation and matching for registered views.

Purpose: Compile route patterns into matchers and resolve request paths
         to a view + path params dict.

Route grammar:
- Must begin and end with '/'.
- Segments are either literal strings or named params in angle-brackets:
  '<name>' where name is a non-empty identifier (letters, digits, underscores).
- Params match exactly one non-empty path segment with no '/' or whitespace.
- No optional segments, no typed converters. Use separate explicit routes
  for each depth.
