"""Fenced-comment stripping for JS embedded in rendered SVG output.

CSS comments don't need this at all -- `svg/styles.css` and
`controls/_styles.css` are authored with Jinja `{# ... #}` comments and
Jinja strips them natively at template-render time, before this module
would ever see them.

JS comments can't use bare `{# ... #}`: the runtime scripts (variables.js,
chart_interactivity.js) are also read raw and executed directly -- the JS
behavioral test suite evals them in jsdom, and Cloud's chat embed ships them
as a plain HTML `<script>` -- so they must stay valid, comment-and-all
JavaScript when nothing preprocesses them. They're authored as
`/*{# ... #}*/`: a real JS block comment whose entire content is the fence
marker. A raw consumer just sees an ordinary comment; this module finds the
literal `/*{#`...`#}*/` span and removes it.

This does NOT need string/regex-literal awareness the way stripping bare
`//`/`/* */` would. `/*{#` is a 4-character sequence real code would not
contain by coincidence -- unlike `//` or `/*`, which show up constantly in
URLs, regexes, and division. As long as authored code never puts that
literal marker text inside a real string, one non-greedy regex is
sufficient and correct.
