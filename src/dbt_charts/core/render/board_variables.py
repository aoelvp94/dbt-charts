"""The board's resolved variable values, scoped for one render pass.

Stage: RENDER
Purpose: Let a render-time decision that depends on a variable's current value
(e.g. which page a paginated table is showing) read it without every caller
having to remember to thread ``variables=`` through.

Consumers (``render_table_svg`` today) read ``current_board_variables()``
themselves rather than requiring each caller to pass a ``variables=``
parameter through — a caller that forgot to opt in is exactly how a prior
variables-plumbing gap shipped (two production call sites silently painted
page 1 regardless of the real page). The scope is opened at each render
pass's own entry point, mirroring ``interactive_controls`` in
``controls.py``: ``render_board_svg`` (``boards.py``) opens it around its own
layout walk, so both the live ``render()`` main pass and ``dct artifact
render``'s replay path (``board_replay.py``) get it from the one place they
both call directly; the sizing pass never calls ``render_board_svg``, so
``renderer.py`` opens a separate scope around ``build_resolved_board``.
