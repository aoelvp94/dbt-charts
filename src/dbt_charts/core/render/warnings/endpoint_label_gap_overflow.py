"""Detector: WARN_ENDPOINT_LABEL_GAP_OVERFLOW, WARN_ENDPOINT_LABEL_RAIL_TIED,
and WARN_ENDPOINT_LABEL_RAIL_OVERFLOW — see their `doc` entries in
`core/diagnostics/codes_render.py`.

Detection rule:
  ``WarningContext.endpoint_label_gap_overflows`` is non-empty for a chart —
  ``recascade_endpoint_labels`` (``render/chart/features/endpoint_labels.py``),
  called from the post-probe correction pass in
  ``render/converters/chart.py``, could not honour the intended pixel gap and
  either distributed labels evenly, or (``rail_overflow``) dropped the labels
  that would not fit, instead.

  The record's ``cause`` picks the code, because the three have different
  remedies: ``gap_did_not_fit`` is fixable with height or fewer series;
  ``no_slope`` is a property of the data and height cannot touch it;
  ``rail_overflow`` means some labels were dropped from the rail entirely.
  Emitting one code for all three told authors to grow a chart that was
  already tall enough, or hid a dropped label behind "labels are cramped."
