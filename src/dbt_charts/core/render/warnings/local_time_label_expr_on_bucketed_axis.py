"""Detector: WARN_LOCAL_TIME_LABEL_EXPR_ON_BUCKETED_AXIS — see its `doc` in
core/diagnostics/codes_render.py for what this fires on.

Covered families: bar (vertical + horizontal, single-metric + multi-metric),
line (single-metric + multi-metric), and area (single-metric + multi-metric).
Heatmap and scatter are NOT covered — both carry the identical UTC/local
off-by-one hazard (confirmed via direct emitter reproduction), but their
emitter paths diverge structurally from bar/line/area; a follow-up task
should implement their coverage.

Detection rule:
  (a) chart.style.axis_x.labels.expr contains a bare local-time accessor
      (timeFormat|year|quarter|month|date|day|hours|week|dayofyear -- not their
      utc-prefixed siblings) outside a string literal, AND
  (b) resolve_cartesian_x_type() returns a calendar grain in
      BUCKETED_CALENDAR_UNITS for this chart's x field, AND
  (c) EITHER vl_type == "temporal" (VL emits a utcX timeUnit transform so
      datum.value is a UTC-midnight Date -- all local-time accessors read it
      in local time)
      OR the x-field data contains at least one value that normalizes to a
      date-only ISO string (YYYY-MM or YYYY-MM-DD) -- the emitted bucket form
      that JS Date.parse treats as UTC midnight -- subject to:
        * `timeFormat`: also requires "toDate(" in the expr (timeFormat on a
          raw ISO string renders 0NaN in both TZs -- wrong but TZ-invariant).
        * date-part accessors (year/month/quarter/date/day/...): no toDate()
          requirement -- they do their own new Date() coercion internally and
          ARE TZ-dependent on a date-only ISO domain without an explicit
          toDate().

Condition (c) distinguishes the real hazard from a merely-broken expression:
a `timeFormat` call on an ordinal axis without toDate() has datum.value = ISO
string -- timeFormat cannot parse it and renders 0NaN in both TZs; silence is
correct there. `month(datum.value)` on the same ordinal axis with date-only
ISO strings coerces the string to a Date internally and reads the month in
local time -- the real hazard, no toDate needed.

The detector mirrors each emitter's preprocessing pipeline exactly:

  bar/line/area, wide or not:
    1. normalize_labeled_temporal (bar.py:427, line.py:92, area.py:96)
    2. gap_fill_ordinal_time_per_panel (bar.py:453, line.py:97, area.py:101)
       — every emitter regroups its (possibly normalize-mutated) rows into
       panels via ``regroup()``/``restripe()`` before gap-fill, so the
       detector does the same rather than calling the flat
       ``gap_fill_ordinal_time`` directly on the whole (cross-panel-pooled)
       row list.
    3. resolve_cartesian_x_type

  A wide (y: [a, b]) chart's pipeline is identical to a regular chart's --
  gap_fill_ordinal_time_per_panel runs before the wide/long-form dispatch in
  every emitter, called with chart.color (the authored dimension a wide
  chart's measures are grouped by, or None), so the dim-cross-join fills the
  same (bucket, dimension) cells for both shapes; there is no separate
  wide-only preprocessing branch left to mirror.

The _ISO_UTC_SAFE_RE gate mirrors _ordinal_bucket_key (complete_ordinal_time_series
canonicalizes x to date-only ISO; '2024-04-15 00:00:00' → '2024-04-15'), same
for wide and regular charts.

Reading the bucketing *decision* (not the emitted Vega-Lite spec) is
deliberate: emitters/bar.py routes many bucketed grains to Vega-Lite's
*ordinal* scale (density gate, yearweek/yearmonthdate, non-January fiscal
year), which emits no ``encoding.x.timeUnit`` at all -- yet condition (c)
gates correctly on vl_type + toDate for each case.
