"""Detector: WARN_TABLE_CRAMPED — see its `doc` in core/diagnostics/codes_render.py.

Tables are a custom SVG renderer with no spec to inspect, so the renderer
records what it actually did into ``WarningContext.table_crampings`` (see
``render/chart/table_overflow.py``). This detector is policy-only: it reads
those captured counts, so the warning describes the render rather than a
second guess at it.
