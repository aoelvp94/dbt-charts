"""Data render output format — flat, slug-keyed queries and charts.

Layout is a presentation concern, so this format drops it: charts are keyed by
slug in one global map regardless of how deeply the layout nests them. Rows
live once per query and charts reference their query by name, so charts sharing
a query never duplicate the result set.
