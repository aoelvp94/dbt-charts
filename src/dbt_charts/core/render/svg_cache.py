"""Content-addressed memo for rendered chart SVGs.

Stage: RENDER (vl-convert)
Purpose: Give a render somewhere to keep the SVG a chart already rendered to, so a
re-render of unchanged content skips vl-convert, which dominates render compute.

The key is **the content**, never the version that asked for it. It hashes the
Vega-Lite spec (which already carries the resolved rows and the theme-cascaded
encodings), the dimensions, the output format, the placeholder flag, the board's
resolved style, the active link context, and a renderer fingerprint. Same key
therefore means byte-identical SVG, and that one property is what the whole
design rests on:

- Staleness is **unrepresentable**, not merely unlikely. New warehouse rows, a
  theme edit, a variable change, an edited nested board, and a vl-convert upgrade
  each produce a different spec or a different fingerprint, so each produces a
  different key. There is no invalidation policy here because there is nothing
  to invalidate — only entries to evict.
- Nothing version-shaped belongs in the key. A board's git blob sha rotates for
  every chart on the board whenever any one of them is edited, so keying on it
  would miss on exactly the case this exists for; keying on it *and* reading the
  previous version's entry would answer with the previous render of the chart
  that just changed. The same goes for a chart's id: it is board-local identity,
  stable across edits while the content under it changes.

**Nothing here touches a database, and that is the whole point.** A durable host
supplies a `loader` — an opaque callable from key to SVG — and the memo consults
it on a miss, once per distinct key it still holds, then buffers what to write
back. So the render reads about one row per distinct chart-content it draws, and
never more because of what the store happens to be holding.

That bound is the reason this is demand-driven rather than bulk-filled. The key
is content, so new warehouse rows mint a fresh key for every chart that drew
them; entries accumulate with *time*, not with a board's chart count. Anything
that fetched a whole board's worth up front would therefore transfer a board's
history into memory to answer for its N charts, and no ceiling on that fetch is
better than not making it — the key of the row you want is already in hand at the
moment you want it.

`board_path` and `chart_id` ride alongside the entries as host metadata and are
never part of the key — the same split `QueryResultCache` makes between its key
and its `board_slug`/`query_name`. Neither is a fetch axis: a lookup is by
content, so they answer only "which chart is this row, and where did it come
from?" — for a host's own debugging and attribution.

    A host that wants durability passes a ``loader`` and reads ``touched`` /
