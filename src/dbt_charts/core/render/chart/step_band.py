"""The band-aware ``step`` curve transform for line/area marks.

On a categorical (nominal/ordinal) x-axis, ``curve: step`` draws a full-band-
width plateau per x-value — a target overlay that visually spans the bars it
compares against — instead of VL's native ``step``, which anchors points at
band centers. On a continuous (temporal/quantitative) x-axis, ``step`` is NOT
band-aware: it falls straight through to VL's own ``step`` interpolate.

Vega-Lite has no per-row ``bandPosition``: it is a per-channel constant, and a
field-valued ``bandPosition`` is silently dropped. So band-spanning is done with
an ``xOffset`` point scale bound to a synthetic edge column: each row is
doubled to ``0`` (band left edge) and ``1`` (band right edge). VL itself only
ever sees ``step-after`` over the doubled rows, so the categorical x-domain is
never expanded — the axis stays clean. ``step-after`` (not centered ``step``)
puts each vertical jump on the RIGHT edge of a doubled pair — i.e. on the band
boundary shared with the next band's first row — which is what the
band-doubled geometry expects. Centered ``step`` would insert a mid-vertex at
the segment midpoint that renders visible mid-band jumps on non-monotonic y.

``connect: false`` adds a ``detail`` channel keyed on the x field so each band
becomes its own path (disconnected plateaus, no vertical bridges between
bands) and insets the xOffset range so adjacent plateaus at a similar y don't
optically weld into one bar. This grouping assumes a single series (the
target-overlay idiom); a data-driven multi-series color encoding is rejected
with a clear error.

Band i's right edge pixel (``x[i] + bandwidth``) and band i+1's left edge
pixel (``x[i+1]``) are meant to be the same point but come from two different
float expressions that occasionally land one ULP apart. Vega-Lite sorts
line/area vertices by x, so at that tie the pair transposes and
``step-after`` draws a zero-width spike into the next band instead of the
plateau. Every emitter driving band-doubled rows through this transform sets
the mark's own ``order: False`` alongside ``BAND_STEP_INTERPOLATE`` — VL's
native switch to draw vertices in dataset order instead of re-sorting them —
so the two always travel together (see ``emitters/_layers.py``'s
``emit_line_layer``/``emit_area_layer``). A synthetic per-row ``order``
*encoding* was tried and rejected for this single-series, non-stacked
band-step case (an ``order`` field inherited from the shared top-level
encoding alongside the ``xOffset`` band scale): Vega-Lite folds the
per-row-distinct field into the area's implicit groupby, so instead of one
continuous filled path it emits one group per doubled row. Each group holds a
single vertex, and an area interpolates *between* vertices — the failure
``sparse_band_transforms`` below exists to prevent — so every group collapses
to a zero-width segment and the filled silhouette is not painted at all. The
chart renders as a bare stroke outline whose plateaus look correct, which is
why a plateau count that scans all paths together cannot detect it.
