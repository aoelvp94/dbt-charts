"""BarHoverBandFeature -- baseline-anchored invisible hover band for bar charts.

Appended as a sub-layer (invisible ``mark="bar"``, ``opacity=0``) after the emitter
so near-zero bars have a wider hover hit-target without any visible change. Two
distinct paths, both gated in ``BarHoverBandFeature.apply``:

Two separate config fractions: ``hover_band_trigger_fraction`` (does this bar/
total need help at all -- default 0.02, deliberately small so the band never
fires on a bar that's already plainly visible) and ``hover_band_extend_fraction``
(how big the band is once it does fire -- default 0.05). Kept distinct so
tightening "when does this fire" doesn't also shrink the hit target once it
does.

- **Non-stacked** (``_append_bar_hover_area``): gated twice. First, a cheap
  Python-side precheck over the chart's own rows: if no row's value is under
  ``hover_band_trigger_fraction`` of the largest, the layer is never declared
  at all -- an unconditional layer would still add an invisible zero-extent
  path per row even when it never extends, which is markup with no hover
  value and shows up as noise in every visual golden diff. Once declared,
  each row is gated again, exactly: anchored at ``scale('ch', 0)`` -- the
  zero baseline -- extending by ``hover_band_extend_fraction`` of the plot's
  pixel extent toward the datum's sign, but ONLY when the bar's own rendered
  extent (read directly off the real bar's scale via
  ``scale(ch, datum[field])``, not the Python-side estimate) is already
  smaller than ``hover_band_trigger_fraction`` of the plot. A bar at or above
  that trigger gets no extended hit area at all -- there's nothing to gain by
  widening an already-adequate hit target.
- **Stacked** (``_append_stacked_total_hover_band``, ``chart.stack == "zero"``
  only): a stacked segment's true position depends on Vega-Lite's own cumulative
  stack transform, which this design deliberately never reimplements (see below)
  -- so instead of a per-row band, at most ONE shared band is added per x-category
  whose stacked TOTAL renders near-invisible (under ``hover_band_trigger_fraction``
  of the domain max), carried by one real row for that x. Per-segment precision is
  unnecessary: ``chart_interactivity.js``'s x-unified tooltip already shows every
  series at a given x once ANY mark there is hovered.

The band has no data, aria override, or sub-layer transform of its own -- it
inherits ``spec.data`` and the shared structured-tooltip description like any
ordinary sub-layer, so it gets its own correct ``aria-label`` and self-identifies
directly on hover, with no proximity-based fallback involved. Both alternatives
were tried and rejected: private per-layer data gets its description forced to
``None`` by ``translate.py::_apply_structured_tooltip``'s "private data means
incompatible row shape" guard; a sub-layer ``transform`` -- even on this LAST
layer, even unrelated to the real bar's own transforms -- makes vl-convert
discard an authored ``encoding.<channel>.sort`` (the documented hazard in
``features/value_labels.py:450-456``; it generalizes to any sub-layer transform,
not just one sharing a layer with the sort-dependent encoding).

Without a transform to exclude null-measure rows, a null measure instead
collapses the band to zero extent via the same sign ternary that already
branches per row. The row's category still reaches the shared x-scale domain
through the band's ordinary field-encoded categorical channel -- exactly as the
real bar layer's own field-encoded x already does independently of the band, via
this repo's ``config.mark.invalid: "break-paths-show-domains"`` fix (see
``test_bar_null_bucket_axis.py``) -- so there is nothing extra for the band to
contribute or diverge on.

``tooltip: True`` in ``band_mark_props`` is load-bearing, not decorative: without
it, a chart with a legend (``LegendToggleFeature``'s ``dct_legend`` param) marks
the band's layer non-interactive (``translate.py`` skips opacity-0 layers when
stamping that param), which Vega compiles straight to ``pointer-events: none`` --
the band would then never receive a mouse event at all on any legend-bearing bar
chart.

Exclusions (all gated in ``applies_to``):
- Histograms: their VL pipeline differs from bar charts.
- Multi-metric (wide) bars (``y: [...]``): no single scalar measure channel.
- Combo-overlay bars (``chart.layers`` set): the overlay pipeline wraps the spec
  into its own layered structure and must remain the sole authority on layers.
- Faceted (``chart.multiples is not None``): ``height``/``width`` in the band
  expression resolve to root-scope Vega signals; child views use
  ``child_height``/``child_width`` instead, so the band would have zero extent.
- Stacked ``normalize``/``center`` (``chart.stack`` neither ``None``/``"none"``
  nor ``"zero"``): not handled by either path above. ``normalize`` always fills
  the full plot height (nothing is ever near-invisible there); ``center``'s
  baseline floats per-x rather than sitting at a fixed zero, which the
  total-tininess math above doesn't account for. A per-ROW band on either would
  repeat the original stacked bug: the band's measure channel would be a fixed
  baseline-relative expression, never stacked, so every series at one x would
  emit an identical unstacked rect and whichever paints last wins every hit
  test -- wrong for hover (lost per-segment tooltip highlight) and wrong for an
  authored ``link:`` (click navigates to the wrong segment's URL).

Assumes 0 is within the measure axis's domain -- true by default, but an
authored non-zero-inclusive ``axis_y.scale.continuous.domain`` can violate it;
Vega then simply clamps the band to the plot floor rather than erroring.
