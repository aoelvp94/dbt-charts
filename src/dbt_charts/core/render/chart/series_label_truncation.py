"""Render-time capture of series labels the endpoint-label rail had to cut.

``measure_label_pane_width`` (in ``emitters/_endpoint_rail.py``) caps the rail
at a fraction of the chart's slot
(``chart_rendering.endpoint_labels.max_width_fraction``); Vega then ellipsizes
any name wider than that at the pane's mark limit. The cut itself is silent —
the rail just reads ``Enterprise Cloud Data Pl…`` — so this module is the seam
that lets the warning detector see it. The measure site records at the exact
point it decides to cap, mirroring ``axis_title_truncation``.

The sink is a ``ContextVar`` set around the spec-generation pass inside
``_collect_render_warnings``. When no sink is open, recording is a no-op.
