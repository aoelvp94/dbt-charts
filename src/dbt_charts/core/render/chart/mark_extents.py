"""Mark geometry read back out of rendered SVG.

Stage: RENDER

Measures the actual painted extent of a chart's marks from its SVG output —
the only place that can see whether a chart's rows produced anything a reader
can see. Distinct from ``render/svg_utils.py``, which owns the chart-agnostic
SVG envelope (dimensions, inner-content extraction); this module is
path-command and elliptical-arc math that only means anything for chart
marks. Keep mark geometry here — don't grow a second SVG-parsing home in
``svg_utils.py``.

Two consumers:
- ``render_chart_item`` (``rendering.py``) calls ``all_marks_degenerate`` (and
  ``chart_has_nonzero_measure``, which reads the chart's own resolved measure
  channel rather than any SVG geometry) to guard against painting nothing.
- The visual-test corpus sweep (``dbt-charts/tests/visual/series_naming.py``)
  calls ``mark_extents`` on a whole rendered board to measure every chart's
  marks at once, keyed by chart id.

Both build on the same subtree walk and the same ``_path_extent``/
``_arc_points`` geometry, so a fix here (e.g. the ``<a xlink:href>``
transparency below) reaches both without a second implementation to drift.

    ``<a xlink:href="…">``, so a direct-children-only scan sees the ``<a>`` and
    reports no mark at all.

    Skips ``opacity="0"`` elements inside ``mark-rect`` groups only. VL bar
    marks render as ``mark-rect`` in the SVG; the hover band
    (``features/bar_hover_band.py``) adds a second ``mark-rect`` layer whose
    paths are always opacity=0 but always have non-zero pixel extent.  Without
    this filter, ``all_marks_degenerate`` would never fire for a blank bar chart
    because the band's 10%-of-height extent is always non-zero even when every
    real bar collapses to zero.

    Other mark families (e.g. ``mark-symbol`` hover points on line charts) are
    legitimately opacity=0 in their initial static state and must still be
    counted so their charts are not mistakenly flagged as blank.

    A ``<path>`` carrying no ``d`` at all counts as a zero-extent mark rather
