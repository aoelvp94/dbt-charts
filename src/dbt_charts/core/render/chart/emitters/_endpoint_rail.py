"""Endpoint-label rail: which layout it uses, and how much horizontal span it claims.

The rail's own width is fully known before the x-axis label-crowding decision
runs (series names and font are baked at resolve time), but it used to be
computed only later, in ``features/endpoint_labels.py``'s feature pass —
after the crowding decision had already picked a tilt angle against the
card's full slot width. This module gives the emitters a way to ask "how much
of my width will the rail eat" *before* that decision, so
``resolve_axis_x_overlap`` can be fed the plot's real width instead of the
slot's.

``features/endpoint_labels.py`` imports ``measure_label_pane_width`` from
here rather than keeping its own copy, so there is exactly one place that
turns a list of series names into a pane width.
