"""Render-time capture of tables that don't fit the width they were given.

A table sizes its columns to honor each one's minimum readable width. When
those widths sum past the width the table was handed (its dashboard tile, or the
page), the renderer has no choice but to widen the whole table past its slot —
so it spills over its neighbor or is clipped, printing columns on top of each
other. Nothing surfaces that to the author.

This module is the seam that lets a warning detector see it. The table renderer
records the overflow at the exact point it decides to widen past its slot — so
the signal is the renderer's own boundary, not a separate guess — into a sink
that ``TABLE_COLUMNS_OVERFLOW`` reads via ``WarningContext.table_overflows``.

The sink is a ``ContextVar`` set around the SVG render, mirroring the existing
render-context vars in ``renderer.py``. Board rendering is single-threaded, so
the renderer's ``record_table_overflow`` call lands in the same context the
collector opened. When no sink is open (non-SVG formats, which never rasterize a
table), recording is a no-op — those formats have no visual overflow to warn
about.

    its slot. Cramping is the quieter ladder below that — the renderer absorbs
    the width shortfall by wrapping headers, and the table still fits its box
    while reading badly. The height axis is not cramping: a slot cutting the
    rows-per-page down is captured as ``TablePageSqueeze``
    (``table_page_squeeze.py``) for WARN-TABLE-PAGE-SQUEEZED, whose grow-the-
    slot fix matches that cause.

    the header label where that is wider); ``available_width`` is the budget
