# render/chart

Chart rendering: resolved charts + query data → Vega-Lite specs (or custom SVG for KPI/table/spark families). Read `dbt-charts/src/dbt_charts/core/AGENTS.md` for the compile→render boundary (no reach-backs); this file owns the chart-layer invariants.

## Implementation philosophy

1. **Extended Vega-Lite grammar.** For anything Vega-Lite supports natively, dbt charts YAML is a thin wrapper over Vega-Lite's own concepts — `x`/`y`/`color`/`size`/`shape`/`theta` map to VL encoding channels; `type: bar` means VL `mark: bar`. Never a parallel chart language.
2. **The translation is mechanical.** Read YAML fields, build the spec, inject query data, apply theme config. No hidden mutations, no data-driven rewrites, no surprise layers (no selection params, rule layers, or overlays the user didn't author). The output spec must be predictable from the input YAML alone.
3. **Data belongs to queries.** No chart-layer aggregation, regrouping, bucketing, or semantic reordering. Wrong grain or ordering → fix the query, never the renderer. Carve-out: replay the baked partition, then transform within a panel. `chart_rows()` (`feature.py`) regroups a chart's rows into its small-multiples panels via `regroup(chart.panel_axes, ...)` — this is applying a partition decision `resolve()` already baked (`panel_axes`), not inventing one. `gap_fill_ordinal_time_per_panel`'s `map_panels()` (`_channels.py`) goes one step further and synthesizes missing-bucket rows *within* each already-baked panel — still not deciding panel membership or dataset meaning, only completing the ordinal axis's own scaffold inside a partition compile already drew. The banned case is a renderer *deciding* dataset meaning (which rows belong to which panel, or what the panels even are); here render only replays a decision compile already made, then fills gaps inside it — the same relationship it already has with the baked tick ladder. Second carve-out: pivot leaf-column order. The pivot reshape (`pivot_table_data`, `table.py`) synthesizes a column axis that exists nowhere in the query's own shape — a query orders *rows*, and no SQL surface addresses the header sequence directly: it reaches it only through first-seen order, which cannot express chronological columns from a non-chronological row order. Ordering that synthesized axis is therefore part of the reshape's own output contract, not a mutation of query data: `_order_col_tuples` sorts a pivot column dimension only where its values carry one canonical order every reference tool applies (temporal → chronological, numeric → ascending) and otherwise preserves first-seen order, which keeps `ORDER BY` the author's lever for categorical dimensions. Wide *row* order remains query-owned and is never touched.
4. **Native-option-first fixes.** A VL chart bug is fixed by wiring through a native VL property (`encoding`, `axis`, `scale`, `legend`, `mark`, top-level), not by adding `_apply_*` policy helpers that inspect data. Before adding renderer logic, answer: which VL property expresses this? can existing settings/config expose it? if neither, name the exact VL gap in code and PR.
5. **Config is the single source of truth — no fallbacks in code.** The narrow engine-config getters (`get_chart_rendering()`, `get_rendering_config()`, `get_terminal_config()`) and the theme cascade are guaranteed complete. Never `config.get("x", 200)`, never a literal default in Python, never re-specifying a value that `vega.config.*` already carries. Missing default → add it to the theme YAML (`defaults/themes/stark.yaml` for structural roots) or `default_config.yml` for engine knobs.

   ```python
   # WRONG — hardcoded default duplicating/contradicting config
   y_axis_config = {"orient": "right", "labelLimit": 200}
   # RIGHT — orient comes from the style preset via vega.config.axisY;
   # label cap from style.charts.axis.labels.max_width in the theme
   ```
6. **Semantic state stays separate from presentation defaults.** Semantic fields (`type`, inferred `format`/`zero`, chosen `x`/`y`) may be unresolved with `auto`/`null` states; presentation defaults (label limits, mark styling, heights) always come from config. Presentation config never silently fills semantic meaning.
7. **Where defaults live:** scaffold + visual chart defaults → `style.charts.*` in theme YAML (emitted by `style_to_vega_lite()`, the sole VL mapper); chart dimensions → `chart.*` in `default_config.yml`; type-specific → `style.charts.<type>.*`; layout → `style.layout.*`. Scaffold = whether/where an element exists (axis side, grid presence, legend placement); visual = how it's painted (color, font, stroke).
8. **No parallel names.** Don't invent `settings.y_axis` when VL has `encoding.y.axis`. And **snake_case only** in authored YAML and Python config — `cornerRadius` → `corner_radius`; `style_to_vega_lite()` translates back to camelCase at the boundary.
9. **Paint order is a dbt charts contract.** The base chart's own series paints first (bottom); `layers` entries paint in authored order on top — `layers[0]` paints second, `layers[-1]` last (front). Order is verbatim positional, never auto-reordered by chart type or mark family, and must be preserved across renderer replacements.
10. **Layer color is a dbt charts contract.** Each data-series layer gets a distinct `color: {datum: <label>}` (label cascade: authored `label:`, else `default_axis_title(layer.y)` — the bound column's own casing, NOT title case, because the base series in the same scale is named the same way and one legend must not carry two conventions) so successive palette slots build the legend. Injection fires only on data-series marks (bar/line/area/circle/square/scatter/trail/rect), never on annotation marks, and is suppressed when an explicit `color:` encoding exists on the layer.
11. **Table numeric columns center on one midpoint.** Header center = number tspan center = header rule center = cell content midpoint (`cell_midpoint = (content_left + content_right) / 2`; numbers anchor `end` at `midpoint + max_number_w/2`). Text columns left-align. One arithmetic expression per element — no alignment fallback branches. Cluster equal-width runs only over *consecutive* numeric columns. **A column's alignment is one verdict, decided once — never per cell.** `TableColumnConfig.align` is final by the time render reads it: authored value, else classified from every cell's shape (`fill_table_column_defaults` / `classify_date_column_align` in `dbt_charts.core.utils`, called once at resolve for an ordinary column or at render's own pivot leaf synthesis — never re-decided from scratch elsewhere). The numeric three-lane path is unconditional on `align` (invariant above). The date path trusts the resolved `align == "right"` as *whether* the column right-aligns, gated by whether the column actually has date-like content — so a plain right-aligned text column (a pie attachment's "share" percent-string column, e.g.) never earns a content-fit lane it wasn't meant to have, and an authored `align: "left"` on a uniformly date-like column has no lane at all, so neither its cells nor its header centers on one. Inside an already-lane-eligible column (numeric or date), a per-cell `is_date_like` check may still route an individual outlier (e.g. a bare year mixed into real numbers) onto the lane its neighbors established — it can route onto a lane, never create or preserve one against an explicit override.
12. **New chart families are registered, never special-cased.** A VL-native family gets an emitter in `emitters/` wired into `get_emitter()` (`emitters/__init__.py`) plus a test in `dbt-charts/tests/core/render/chart/test_render_emitters.py`. Non-VL families (kpi, table, spark_bar, callout) are custom SVG: they short-circuit through `BoardRenderSession.render_svg_family` and deliberately have no emitter — `get_emitter` raises `ERR-EMITTER-NOT-FOUND` for them (pinned by `test_get_emitter_rejects_non_vl`).
13. **A documented table-formatting behavior needs a pinning test in the same PR.** Before adding or changing a `style.columns`/`style.table` behavior in `table.py`/`table_support.py`, read `docs/reference/table-formatting-qa-matrix.md` — it maps every documented table-formatting behavior to its pinning test(s); a new behavior needs a matrix row plus a pinning test alongside it.

Before adding chart logic, ask: does VL already support this (pass through)? am I renaming something VL names? am I hardcoding a default? am I mutating the spec based on data (make it opt-in)? would a user reading the YAML be surprised by the output?

### If you catch yourself thinking…

| Objection | Response |
|---|---|
| "the data's shape is wrong, I'll fix it in the renderer" | Data belongs to queries. Raise `ChartDataError` or fix the query — a chart-local fix is a hidden second transformation pipeline. |
| "just default it to 300 if the config is missing" | The cascade is guaranteed complete; a missing value is a theme bug. Add the default to the theme YAML and read it. |
| "a small `_apply_*` helper can pick a nicer value from the data" | That's renderer-side policy. Wire the native VL option; data-driven presentation must be explicitly opt-in. |
| "users will want lines painted over bars, reorder for them" | Paint order is the authored `layers:` order — a contract, not a bug. Users who want line-on-top write the line layer last. |
| "bake hover/crosshair layers into the spec for static outputs" | Surprise layers violate the thin-wrapper contract (the old crosshair generator was ~140 lines for what should be 5 — deleted). Interactivity belongs to the embedding surface. |
| "this needs a chart-root escape hatch (`spec`, `mark`, `encoding`)" | The authored surface accepts typed fields only — see the accepted/rejected table in `dbt-charts/src/dbt_charts/core/AGENTS.md`. |

## Where dbt charts adds value beyond Vega-Lite

| Feature | Why it exists |
|---------|--------------|
| KPI charts (`type: kpi`) | Single-number display — not a VL chart type |
| Tables (`type: table`) | Custom SVG, not VL |
| Spark bars (`type: spark_bar`) | Inline sparkline bars, custom SVG |
| Geo maps (`type: map`, `point_map`) | Built-in geo sources, join logic, projection defaults on VL's geoshape |
| Theming / style presets | Theme cascade merged into VL `config` |
| Data binding | Query results injected into `data.values` |
| YAML shorthand | `x: date` instead of verbose VL encoding objects |

## File layout

| File | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| `vega_lite.py` | Thin public entrypoints for chart rendering and spec generation |
| `rendering.py` | Chart / layout-item orchestration: execute the query, resolve to render-ready semantics, dispatch chart vs nested board |
| `session.py` | `BoardRenderSession` — per-board coordinator. `render_svg_family` short-circuits non-VL families to their SVG renderer; VL families run `emit_chart` → `finalize_vl` |
| `emitter.py`, `emitters/` | `ChartEmitter` protocol plus one emitter per VL family (`area`, `bar`, `geo`, `heatmap`, `line`, `pie`, `scatter`), dispatched by `get_emitter()` in `emitters/__init__.py`. `emit()`'s `dataset` is a `ChartDataset` (`compile.resolve.chart._chart_rows`, panel-split, `axes == ()` for a non-faceted chart) — emitters take `dataset.all_rows()` as their first line (commonly rebound to a local `data`) for flat/column-wise work; an aggregating helper must iterate `dataset.panels` instead. Shared internals, also under `emitters/`: `_cartesian`, `_channels`, `_layers`, `_overlay` (authored `layers` paint order), `_tooltip`, `_label_overlap`, `_measured_label_padding` |
| `feature.py`, `features/` | `ChartFeature` protocol, `FeaturePipeline`, and the cross-family overlays (`baseline`, `endpoint_labels`, `value_labels`, `click_interactivity`, `structured_tooltip`, `mirror_axis`, `facet`). `chart_rows(chart, datasets)` returns a `ChartDataset`, regrouped by the chart's baked `panel_axes` (the N=1 case for a non-faceted or non-cartesian chart) — most feature callers want `.all_rows()` immediately; a caller doing per-panel work reads `.panels` directly. `DEFAULT_FEATURES` list order **is** application order |
| `spec.py`, `_types.py` | `ChartSpec`, the render-local intermediate emitters produce and features mutate; `VLDict`, the single sanctioned `dict[str, Any]` alias for VL spec fragments |
| `translate.py` | `assemble_final_vl` — the one `ChartSpec` → Vega-Lite assembly point (config, background, title) |
| `presentation.py` | Shared presentation helpers (axis config, tooltips, config-driven defaults) |
| `spec_builders.py`, `serialization.py`, `artifacts.py`, `type_inference.py` | Spec scaffolding, JSON helpers, render output types, VL type inference from data |
| `emitters/geo.py`, `geo_tooltip.py` | Geo specs and tooltips (data joins, projections, TopoJSON) |
| `kpi.py`, `table.py`, `spark.py`, `spark_bar.py`, `callout.py` | Non-VL renderers (custom SVG) |
| `validation.py` | Data-shape validation policy |
| `../converters/chart.py` | SVG/PNG/PDF/JSON artifact conversion |
