"""Render-time capture of user-visible text truncations.

Generalises the axis-title seam to all truncation surfaces. The ContextVar
sink is opened by ``_collect_render_warnings`` in ``renderer.py`` before the
spec-generation/render pass; recording functions called from chart renderers
write into it as a side-effect, then detectors under ``render/warnings/``
read the collected dict via ``WarningContext.text_truncations``.

``surface`` discriminates which detector owns the record:
  "axis_title"   — cartesian x/y axis title (emitters/_cartesian.py)
  "chart_title"  — chart title or subtitle (title_overflow.py)
  "kpi_label"    — KPI card label (kpi.py)
  "kpi_inline_fallback" — inline KPI variant fell back to stacked (kpi.py)
  "table_header" — table column header (table.py)
  "table_cell"   — table body cell (table.py)
  "callout_text" — callout title, message, or hint (callout.py)
  "spark_label"  — spark-bar row label (spark_bar.py)

``authored_field`` is the YAML key or column name the squiggle should point
at, e.g. "x_label", "title", "label", or a column name for tables.
``authored_text`` is the full text before truncation — except on
"kpi_inline_fallback", where the record isn't a text cut but a whole-variant
degradation (inline -> stacked); there ``authored_field`` is "variant" and
``authored_text`` is the variant the author wrote ("inline").
