"""Render-time capture of a support_table column block over-claiming card width.

Mirrors ``text_truncation.py``'s ContextVar-sink shape: the fact ("the column
block takes more than its reasonable share of the card") is only knowable
while ``support_table_attachment.py`` is building the column block's
geometry — a render concern, since it depends on font-measured column
widths computed from the executed query's own rows, not something knowable
at compile time the way ``plot_height_floor_px``'s height estimate is.

``_collect_render_warnings`` in ``renderer.py`` opens the sink before the
spec-generation pass; ``_apply_support_table_columns_post_pass`` records into
it as a side effect; ``render/warnings/plot_width_below_minimum.py`` reads the
collected dict via ``WarningContext.plot_width_share_warnings``.

This is the softer, earlier signal than the hard floor (checked in
``render/layout_sizing.py``'s width-correction re-render, which raises using
``get_chart_rendering().support_table.plot_width_floor_ratio`` directly — a
single multiply over an already-sanctioned engine-config getter, with no
compile-side module of its own): a chart can trip this warning while its
plot still clears the hard floor by a comfortable margin, or it can trip
both.
