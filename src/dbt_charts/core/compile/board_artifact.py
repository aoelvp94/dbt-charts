"""Board-artifact codec — hoist repeated resolved styles into a shared table.

A serialized ``ResolvedBoard`` carries a full ``ResolvedStyle`` tree (~81 KB) on
the root *and* on every nested board, all byte-identical in practice. That makes
69-88% of an artifact redundant bytes, scaling with nesting depth rather than
with anything a reader cares about.

In memory the repetition costs nothing — every board shares one style object by
reference; only serialization expands it N times. So this is a serialization
concern only, and the fix lives here rather than in the models: ``hoist_styles``
replaces each occurrence with a ``{"$style_ref": <sha256>}`` marker and collects
the styles into a table keyed by the hash of their canonical JSON;
``inline_styles`` is the exact inverse.

Content-addressing, rather than assuming a single style, is what keeps this
correct when a nested board legitimately resolves a *different* style: N distinct
styles simply produce N table entries, with no special case.

``dump_resolved_board_artifact`` / ``load_resolved_board_artifact`` wrap the
codec in the publishable envelope: ``{$id, version, styles, board}``. ``$id``
names the schema this document conforms to
(``board-resolved.schema.json``) and ``version`` is the producing
``dbt-charts`` release — metadata a non-Python consumer needs to interpret the
``$style_ref`` markers correctly, since ``ResolvedBoard``/``ResolvedStyle``
themselves are unchanged and know nothing about hoisting.
