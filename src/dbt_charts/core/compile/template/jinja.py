"""Jinja template resolution module.

Stage: COMPILE (Part of Step 3: Normalization)
Purpose: Resolve Jinja templates in queries and SQL strings.

Entry Points:
    - resolve_jinja_template(template: str, variables: Dict) -> str
    - extract_variable_dependencies(template: str) -> Set[str]

Inputs:
    - Template strings with {{ variable }} syntax
    - Variable values for substitution

Outputs:
    - Resolved strings with variables substituted
    - Set of variable names referenced in templates

Dependencies:
    - jinja2 (Environment, Template, meta)

Errors:
    - JinjaError: Template syntax or resolution errors

See also:
    - compile/normalize/dispatch.py: Uses this module

Security Note:
    When using strict=False (lenient mode), undefined variables are silently
    converted to empty strings. This mode should ONLY be used in interactive
    contexts (chart editor) where the user is actively editing and expects
    partial results. Production rendering should always use strict=True.
