"""Board-wide category→color planning.

One data value gets one swatch across every chart on a board. Without this,
each chart hands Vega-Lite only the values *it* happens to see; VL sorts them
and assigns palette slots positionally, so the same category lands on a
different swatch in every chart, and adding one category reflows the rest.

The planner is pure: per-chart observed values in, one scale per bound field
out. Enumerating those values needs executed rows, so the caller runs after
execute — see ``execute/category_colors.py``.

# (`_emit_histogram` in `bar.py` never does). This list and each emitter's own
# choice to read `chart.category_colors` are two independently-maintained
# lists, so a family declared here whose emitter ignores the scale (or the
# reverse) is caught by
# `test_binding_capability_matches_every_authored_chart_family` in

# A tag NOT in this set neither binds nor widens the board's domain — the

# unconverted family is harmless rather than drift-producing.

# This set is HAND-MAINTAINED, not derived from the emitters, and that is
# deliberate rather than an oversight: the real fact this frozenset encodes
# ("does this family's emit path read the board scale") only exists inside
# `render/chart/emitters/`, but this planner lives in `compile/`, which must
# never import `render/` — `tach.toml`'s `dbt_charts.core.compile` module
# declares an explicit `depends_on` list that omits both `render` and
# `execute`, and `tests/core/test_layering.py::test_compile_does_not_import_render`
# is a second, dependency-free AST guard over every file under `core/compile/`
# asserting the same thing. Importing an emitter-side registry here to derive
# this set would invert that boundary. The only way to keep a single
# declaration site without breaking it would be moving the set itself into
# `render/` — but the planner's threshold gate needs it during compile, before
# any emitter runs, so `render/` isn't reachable from here either. The
# exhaustive `test_binding_capability_matches_every_authored_chart_family`
# above is the drift guard in place of a mechanical derivation: it fails the
