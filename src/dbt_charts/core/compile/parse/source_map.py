"""YAML source map: dotted authoring path -> SourceRange.

Built once per compile from PyYAML's composed node tree (``yaml.compose()``),
which carries a ``start_mark``/``end_mark`` per node — the first real
(non-regex) source of positions in this codebase, and the first producer of
columns (every range before this shipped with ``columns=None`` because
nothing could fill one).

Compile owns the authored buffer, so the map builder lives here. The
stamping pass (``stamp_diagnostics``) is deliberately separate and takes an
already-built map as a plain argument — it does no parsing and cannot raise,
so callers above compile (e.g. the render/compile result-assembly seam in
``board.py``) can stamp render-side diagnostics against a compile-built
map without re-running any compile behavior.

    bare top-level section.

    ``charts.c1.style.axis_y.format`` -> ``[..., "charts.c1.style", "charts.c1"]``,
    never ``"charts"``. That last step is excluded because it is the one
    candidate that stops being *about the thing named*: ``charts``' range is
    every chart in the file, so a diagnostic about one chart that no longer
    exists would squiggle all of them — the exact whole-block mark this walk
    exists to remove. A single-segment key (``title``, ``text``) is its own only
    candidate: it names a top-level key directly, so resolving to itself is
    right.

    Nothing here consults the map. The caller stops at the first candidate that
    resolves, and when none does, ``range`` stays ``None`` rather than being
    fabricated.
