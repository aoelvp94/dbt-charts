"""Cache policy models — authored overlay, resolved policy, duration parsing.

Stage: COMPILE (Input + Resolution)
Purpose: The typed ``cache:`` layer authorable at four scopes (project config →
source → board → query) and the fully-resolved per-query
``CachePolicy`` the executor consumes. Resolution is compile-time: the
normalizer merges the layers field-by-field (nearest scope wins) via
``resolve_cache_policy`` so no cascade logic exists in execute.

The shipped cascade root lives in ``defaults/default_config.yml`` under
``cache:`` — no in-code root default. Every scope is authored as a scalar::

    cache: 1h         # on, expire after an hour
    cache: forever     # on, never auto-expire
    cache: false       # off — the only opt-out
    cache: true        # on, inherit the parent scope's ttl

The project root takes every spelling but ``true``: with no scope above it, an
inherited ttl is not a thing it can have, and the word would quietly resolve to
never-auto-expire (see ``ProjectCacheConfig``).

Unset fields always inherit from the parent *scope* (``exclude_unset``
semantics, mirroring the style ``*Patch`` overlay discipline), so
``cache: 5m`` on a query refines an inherited policy rather than replacing it.
Between *files* — a ``charts/meta.yml`` and the board beneath it — the same
field-by-field rule applies, which is why ``cache: true`` on a board keeps the
directory's ttl instead of jumping to the project root's. The block form
(``cache: {ttl: 5m}``) means exactly the same thing as the scalar and is what
the project scope uses to carry its extra ``path`` key.

``ttl`` lives directly on the layer (no ``invalidate:`` nesting). A future
watermark trigger would join it as a flat sibling key
(``cache: {ttl: 1h, watermark: "SELECT max(...)"}``), not as a submap.
