"""Generic patch-model factory for compiled style/config models.

This module owns two public factories:

``build_patch_model(compiled_cls)``
    All-Optional authored-overlay variant.  Nested BaseModel fields are
    recursively converted to their Patch versions
    (e.g. ``PaddingStyle → PaddingStylePatch | None``).  Use for ``*Patch``
    types in ``authored.py``.

``build_patch_model_ext(compiled_cls, is_recursive)``
    Parameterised variant.  Pass ``is_recursive=False`` to make every field
    ``T | None = None`` while keeping nested BaseModel fields as their
    original compiled types (e.g. ``PaddingStyle | None``).  Use for
    cascade-sentinel bases where cascade fills fields with compiled values.
