"""Resolved style channel data type.

This module holds only the frozen dataclass that represents a single
resolved style channel — the OUTPUT of the channel parsing ENGINE in
``dbt_charts.core.compile.resolve.chart.channel``.  Placing the data type here lets the
render layer import the resolved IR without pulling in compile internals.
