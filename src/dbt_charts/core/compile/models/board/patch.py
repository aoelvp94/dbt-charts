"""Board patch model: all-optional overlay used by the merge engine.

``BoardPatch`` is the all-optional counterpart to ``AuthoredBoard``, generated
mechanically by ``build_patch_model``.  Every field that carries a ``Merge``
annotation on ``AuthoredBoard`` has that annotation forwarded here, so
``merge_patches`` can read the strategy directly from the patch model's field
metadata without consulting the canonical model.

``EMPTY_PATCH`` is the all-None, no-fields-set sentinel used as the accumulator
base in ``merge_extends`` / ``merge_metas`` before any fragment is layered on.
