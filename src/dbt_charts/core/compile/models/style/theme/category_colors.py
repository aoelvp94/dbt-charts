    """One field's board-wide value→palette-slot assignment.

    A value's identity here is its **slot**, not a hex. Every palette a chart
    derives is indexed by that same slot: `endpoint_labels.py` takes a series'
    fill from `palette[i]` and its label ink from `dark_companion_palette[i]`
    on adjacent lines, and `pie.py` pairs wedge stops with dark stops the same
    way. Handing render a finished hex would fix the fill and leave every
    companion pointing at whatever used to occupy that position.

    Carrying the slot also lets a nested board keep the theme it resolved: both
    boards agree a value owns slot 2, and each paints slot 2 out of its own
    palette rather than being overpainted by the root's.

    ``overrides`` holds pins naming a color the palette does not contain. Such
    a value still owns a slot — that is what its companion ink indexes — but
    its fill is the literal the author wrote. Built by
    ``plan_category_colors``; display order is deliberately absent, because
    reordering a domain is what desynchronizes everything downstream.

    ``unseen_pins`` holds pins authored for this field whose value none of
    this render's rows actually draw — ``_seatable_pins``
    (``compile/resolve/style/category_colors.py``) drops such a pin rather
    than seating it (seating would claim a slot for a category nothing
    draws and push every real value along one). The drop stays silent for
    color assignment, but not for the author: the render-time
    ``WARN-CATEGORY-COLOR-PIN-UNSEEN`` detector reads this field to warn
    that the pin did nothing. Value → the authored color, in authored
    order. Empty for a scale whose pins all matched.
