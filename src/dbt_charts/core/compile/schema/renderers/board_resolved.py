"""Board-resolved JSON Schema renderer — the resolved-board artifact schema.

Emits the JSON Schema for the publishable artifact envelope
(``board_artifact.dump_resolved_board_artifact``): ``{$id, version, styles,
board}``, where ``board`` is a ``ResolvedBoard`` (the frozen render contract
produced by ``build_resolved_board`` / ``build_resolved_board_static``) with
every ``style`` occurrence replaced by a ``$style_ref`` pointer into
``styles``. Unlike the authored-side board schema (``json_schema.py``, built
from the ``AuthorableSchema`` IR), ``ResolvedBoard`` is never hand-authored by
users, so its schema is the direct Pydantic/dataclass introspection — no IR
layer needed.

The envelope shape has no Python type of its own — hoisting is a
serialization-only transform (see ``board_artifact.py``) that never touches
``ResolvedBoard``/``ResolvedStyle`` — so this renderer post-processes the
Pydantic-generated ``ResolvedBoard`` schema: it swaps the one ``style``
property in ``$defs.ResolvedBoard`` for a ``$defs.StyleRef`` pointer (the
``$defs`` entry is recursive, so this single edit covers the root board and
every nested board) and wraps the result in the envelope object.

Entry point: ``render_board_resolved_schema(version: str) -> JsonSchemaValue``
