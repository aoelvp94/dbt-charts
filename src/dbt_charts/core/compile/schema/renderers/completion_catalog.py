"""Assemble the dbt charts YAML completion catalog for editor autocomplete.

The catalog is the generated VS Code JSON Schema (``render_vscode_schema``),
which already carries the built-in theme enum. Both the Cloud dashboard
editor and the Playground fetch it to drive schema-aware completions, so its
assembly lives here once rather than being duplicated per host. It is
generated once and cached for the process lifetime.
