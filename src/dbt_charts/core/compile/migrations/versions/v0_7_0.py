"""Version-migration module for the unreleased 0.6.0 -> 0.7.0 boundary.

Declares the pending structural changes since the 0.6.0 freeze. Named for the
predicted next minor version -- the manifest's DEV entry -- rather than a
``current`` placeholder; renamed only if the predicted version itself changes
before release (a major bump, or a patch release that ships a grammar
change).

THIS FILE IS SCHEMA CHANGES ONLY. Do not add an entry here for anything that
is not a key rename, a key removal, or an authored value's meaning changing
in place (the unmigratable-redefinition case, which still owes the author a
signal per ``migrations/AGENTS.md``). A renderer-default tweak, a bug fix, a
performance change, a visual behavior change, an internal refactor -- none of
these are grammar changes, and none of them get a bullet here, no matter how
significant. If you cannot point to the ``Move``, ``Deletion``, or in-place
redefinition backing your bullet, it does not belong in this file. Put it in the task
or the PR description instead. See ``migrations/AGENTS.md``'s "If you catch
yourself thinking..." table.

Changes in this release:

- Two dead root-level ``style:`` fields removed:

  - ``style.page`` (``PageStyle`` had exactly one field, ``background``).
    Deletion tail is ``("style", "page")``, not ``("page", "background")``:
    the old grammar allowed a bare ``page: {}``/``page: null`` with no
    required fields, so a tail scoped to ``background`` alone would leave
    those two shapes unrecognized. Anchored at ``style`` rather than a bare
    ``("page",)`` — same reasoning as ``v0_5_0.py``'s ``("style",
    "tooltip")`` precedent: the schema walk only ever matches this tail under
    ``style``, and the anchored form says which ``page:`` the declaration
    means at the declaration. It strips all three authored shapes
    (``style.page.background: ...``, ``style.page: {}``,
    ``style.page: null``) and is auto-stripped by ``dct migrate``.
  - ``style.color`` (a per-board text-color override) was fully inert — it
    never rendered — so it is stripped, not moved: its natural hand-edit
    target ``style.font.color`` *is* live, and redirecting an inert value onto
    it would change every affected board's render instead of preserving it.
    ``color`` is one of the most common leaf names in the schema, and the
    Deletion is declared on the bare tail ``("style", "color")`` anyway:
    ``_live_declares_tail`` fires it only where the live grammar has stopped
    declaring the tail, which is a board's own style block (root and nested
    alike) and nowhere else. Every chart family's chart-local
    ``style.color`` keeps its value.

- ``conditional_formatting:`` retired from 11 ``type:`` literals: ``bar``,
  ``histogram``, ``line``, ``area``, ``scatter``, ``pie``, ``donut``, ``map``,
  ``geoshape``, ``point_map``, ``bubble_map``, kept unchanged on ``table``
  and ``kpi``, the only two families whose render path meaningfully honors
  every (table) or some (kpi) of the field's rule outputs; the other seven
  only ever lowered ``rule.background`` onto the mark fill, with `font`,
  `glyph`, `glyph_color`, and `tone` silently discarded. Declared
  as 11 ``Deletion`` entries below (``CONDITIONAL_FORMATTING_RETIRED_CHART_TYPES``),
  one per removed ``type:`` literal, each scoped via ``Deletion.chart_type``
  so the shared path ``("conditional_formatting",)`` retires only on its own
  family and a board mixing a retired family with ``table``/``kpi`` in one
  file migrates correctly on both the in-memory and ``dct migrate`` text
  paths. See ``Deletion.chart_type``'s own docstring in ``migrations.py``
  for why a bare per-path deletion cannot express this.


- ``axis*.grid.zero`` renamed to ``axis*.grid.threshold``. The block styles the
  heavy rule drawn where a quantitative axis crosses a meaningful threshold, and
  it always styled more than zero — the unity rule at 1.0 on a ratio axis read
  the same block — so the old spelling named only one of the thresholds it
  governed. It also gains a ``visible`` flag, the targeted off switch: before it,
  the only way to silence the rule was ``grid.visible: false``, which took every
  gridline on the axis with it.

  Declared via ``suffix_rename_moves`` in ``THRESHOLD_RENAMES`` below, anchored
  two segments deep (``grid`` + ``threshold``) rather than on a bare
  ``threshold`` tail. The anchor is hygiene rather than necessity —
  ``suffix_rename_moves`` matches on the NEW tail, so a bare ``("threshold",)``
  could not have collided with the unrelated ``scale.continuous.zero`` boolean
  either — but the qualified form says at the declaration which ``zero`` moved.

  Same self-nesting caveat as every other position-scoped rename in this file:
  ``_relative_field_paths``' ``seen`` guard makes a self-nested ``AuthoredBoard``
  opaque, so a sub-board reached by recursion is not walked and its own
  ``grid.zero`` is not rewritten.

- Pie/donut ``total.format`` moved from chart-root copy to
  ``style.total.value.format`` paint. It never belonged beside `total.label`
  (author intent, chart-local copy) -- every other format field in the schema
  (`TooltipStyle.format`, `BarTotalLabelStyle.format`, axis `labels.format`)
  lives in style, and pinning `total.format` to chart root blocked board- and
  theme-level format overrides that those fields get for free.

  Declared via ``suffix_rename_moves`` in ``TOTAL_FORMAT_RENAMES`` below,
  same mechanism as ``THRESHOLD_RENAMES`` despite the differing tail depth --
  the shared prefix (``charts.<id>``) is preserved either way. The
  corresponding board-tier position, ``style.charts.pie.total.value.format``,
  has no old-grammar counterpart (chart-root ``total`` was never
  theme-cascaded), so ``suffix_rename_moves`` silently drops that candidate
  rather than producing a Move for it.
