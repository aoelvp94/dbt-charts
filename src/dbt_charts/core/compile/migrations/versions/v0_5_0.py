"""Version-migration module for the 0.4.0 -> 0.5.0 structural changes.

Declares the frozen ``0.4.0 → 0.5.0`` boundary's renames, key removals, and
conditional relocations. ``moves()``, ``deletions()``, and
``conditional_moves()`` all source from the frozen ``0.4.0`` schema and
target the frozen ``0.5.0`` schema. This file was authored as
``versions/current.py`` while these changes were unreleased (declaring the
``catalog.latest.version → current`` boundary) and renamed here with no
content edit at release time — every function already accepts
``source_schema`` and ``target_schema`` as runtime parameters, so no
hardcoded version strings needed to change.

Changes in this release:

- interactive_legend removed from LegendStyle (field never had any effect in
  the static-SVG render pipeline; see the removal task for rationale).

- tooltip removed from all chart-family styles (both theme-level per-family
  overrides and chart-level style blocks): tooltip config was never consumed
  by the static-SVG pipeline. Affects all 11 families (bar, line, area,
  scatter, heatmap, histogram, pie, geoshape, point_map, kpi, table).
  Auto-stripped by dct migrate; authors should remove the keys.

- legend removed from KpiChartStyle and TableChartStyle theme-level per-family
  overrides (kpi and table never paint a legend). The theme-level
  style.charts.kpi.legend and style.charts.table.legend keys are auto-stripped
  by dct migrate via Deletion; the equivalent chart-level style.legend on a kpi
  or table chart raises a clear error with a removal hint (the style.legend tail
  cannot be expressed as a Deletion because painting families keep it).

  aspect_ratio / min_height / max_height at the theme level
  (style.charts.kpi.* / style.charts.table.*) cannot be expressed as a
  Deletion: the frozen 0.4.0 schema never declared them in KpiChartStylePatch
  or TableChartStylePatch — only a @cache-divergence runtime bug accepted them.
  There is no structural schema history to migrate from, so dct migrate cannot
  strip them. Instead, the compiler now raises a clear error with a manual-
  action hint (per the repo guide's fail-loud exemption for changes with no
  prior schema representation). Authors must remove these keys by hand.

- style.board: renamed to style.frame: (BoardStyle -> FrameStyle) as part of
  the 2026-08 rebrand vocabulary cut (dbt-charts/AGENTS.md's terminology table).
  The rebrand's other rename, ``LayoutItem.type: "face"`` -> ``"board"``, has
  no Move here: that field lives only on the NORMALIZE-stage ``Board`` model
  (compile/models/board/normalized.py), never on ``AuthoredBoard`` -- no
  authored YAML ever writes a literal ``type: face``, so there is no authored
  key for a migration to recognize or rewrite. The rename of that internal
  literal is a pure code change, with nothing for ``dct migrate`` to do.

- marks.square / marks.tick / marks.trail removed from GlobalMarksStyle: these
  three mark slots have no AuthoredChart variant (square/tick/trail are raw
  Vega-Lite marks, not authorable chart types). Style authored under
  style.charts.marks.square/tick/trail was previously validated-and-silently-
  ignored; it now raises an extra-forbidden error. dct migrate strips these keys.

- KPI style.tone retired; support.tone is now the only tone field on KPI
  charts (editorial convention: headline neutral, delta/support colored).
  When a face has an existing support: block, style.tone is moved into
  support.tone automatically.  When there is no support: block, style.tone is
  dropped and a warning names the chart (KpiSupportConfig._require_non_empty
  rejects a support: block with only tone set, so inventing one would produce
  invalid output).  Callout charts, which also have style.tone, are not
  touched — the ConditionalMove is scoped to chart_type="kpi".

- animation_duration removed from all chart style models (ChartsStyle,
  all 11 per-family theme patches, and chart-level style). The field never
  had any effect in the static-SVG render pipeline.
  Auto-stripped by dct migrate; authors should remove the keys.

- Chart-level style.scale removed from all six cartesian chart families
  (bar, line, area, scatter, histogram, heatmap) and from the per-family
  theme slots.  Only the continuous.zero sub-field had any effect on bar,
  line, and area (the smart-zero baseline decision).  When the chart already
  has a style.axis_y: block, that field is relocated to
  style.axis_y.scale.continuous.zero automatically.  When the chart has no
  style.axis_y block, dct migrate raises IncompleteMigrationError — the
  author must add style.axis_y.scale.continuous.zero by hand.
  Histogram and heatmap had no functional sub-fields;
  their chart-level scale: fails loud on the new schema (extra_forbidden)
  and is not migrated — authors should use style.axis_x.scale and
  style.axis_y.scale directly.  Scatter chart-level scale: also fails loud;
  authors should move domain/type/nice/padding/zero to axis_x.scale or
  axis_y.scale directly.

- allow_html: bool renamed and retyped to html_policy:
  Literal["none","safe-subset","trusted-raw"]. The mapping is total and
  lossless: allow_html: true -> html_policy: "trusted-raw" (the prior field
  wired directly to raw-HTML rendering); allow_html: false -> html_policy:
  "none" (the prior default). Move.value_map carries the value translation;
  an unmapped value raises MigrationError rather than silently passing
  through.

- scale.domain now rejects a null element (`domain: [1.0, null]`), which
  previously validated and was then discarded in silence. No migration: the
  missing bound would have to be invented, so a transform is not expressible
  (the guide's fail-loud carve-out). Authors give both bounds, or omit the key.

- style.variables.padding, style.variables.container_padding, and
  style.variables.popover_rail_background removed from VariablesStyle without
  replacement. Auto-stripped by dct migrate; authors should remove the keys.

- style.variables.value.numeric_variant removed from VariablesValueStyle
  without replacement. Auto-stripped by dct migrate; authors should remove
  the key.

- style.text.column.number renamed to style.text.column.max_number, and its
  meaning changed from a fixed column count to a ceiling the renderer may
  undershoot when there isn't enough text to fill every column. Not a
  lossless rename, but the authored value passes through unchanged rather
  than failing loud -- a deliberate release-time choice, not an oversight.
