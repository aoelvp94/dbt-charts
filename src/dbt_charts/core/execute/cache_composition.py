"""Isolated-DuckDB execution over named in-memory rowsets.

Runs author-controlled SQL over named row-dict sets in a fresh in-process DuckDB
with external access disabled. The engine's namespace holds ONLY the registered
rows — no application tables, no other cache entries, nothing on any shared or
application-database connection — so the SQL cannot read data outside the rows it
explicitly references. This is the one home for both ``{{ queries.X.cache }}``
composition (fed the upstream rows by the executor) and the Cloud file-source
path (fed the materialized file rows).

    """Execute *sql* over *named_rows* in an isolated in-process DuckDB.

    Each entry in *named_rows* is registered as a table under its key (a
    zero-copy Arrow table). *sql* is parameterized ($1/$2/…) with *params*
    bound by the driver — never string-interpolated — and external access is
    disabled, so the composing SQL can reach neither the filesystem/network nor
    any table other than the registered rows.

    Args:
        sql: Parameterized composing SQL; every table reference must resolve to
            a key of *named_rows*.
        named_rows: Mapping of table name → row dicts to register.
        params: Positional parameter values in $1/$2/… order.
        limit: Bounds the fetch itself via ``fetchmany()`` — a join across two
            upstream tables each near the row ceiling can otherwise blow up
            memory during composition, before any post-fetch check runs. None
            fetches everything.

    Returns:
        List of row dicts.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: Wraps any DuckDB execution error with context (including a
            reference to a table that is not one of the registered rowsets).
