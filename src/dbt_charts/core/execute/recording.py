"""BoardRecording: the sidecar written beside a resolved-board artifact.

A resolved board's published contract (`ResolvedBoard`) deliberately carries no
data — see `execute/replay_provider.py`. This module is the other half: the
typed shape of the sidecar file that carries the rows, the variable values
they were captured under, and when they were captured, plus the loader that
turns a registered `ERR-*` code loose on a malformed one instead of a bare
`pydantic.ValidationError` reaching a user-facing CLI/MCP call.
