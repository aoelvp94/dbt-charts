"""Enumerate the categorical values a board draws, then plan its color scales.

Stage: EXECUTE. The planner itself is pure and lives in compile
(``compile/resolve/style/category_colors.py``); the values it plans over can
only be known after the queries run, which is why the walk lives here.

Queries are board-global and executor-cached, so this pass costs one dict walk
per chart — the rows it reads are the same ones the sizing pass reads next.

    A chart whose query fails is skipped rather than aborting the board: its

    A field a chart ENCODES (an authored `color:` naming it) but whose values
    `_observe` genuinely DISQUALIFIED for that chart — non-string, or
    unanimously date-like — POISONS the field board-wide. `_bound_scales`

    cannot know them at resolve time), so a scale that cannot seat this
    chart's values can never safely bind for ANY chart on the board — dropping
    the field here is the only way to keep that promise. This matches the
    same "decline rather than break a board that rendered fine" policy
    `plan_category_colors` already applies to palette exhaustion and the
    two-chart threshold: every chart keeps the coloring it has today.

    An EMPTY result — no rows, or a color column that is null in every row —
    is not a disqualification: a chart with no values to seat can never be
    mis-seated by any scale, so it simply contributes nothing to the domain
    and does not poison the field. Without this distinction, a runtime data
    change that empties one chart's result (a `dct serve` variable, a filter)
