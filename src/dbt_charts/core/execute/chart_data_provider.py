"""The data seam the post-resolve render path depends on.

``render_board_svg`` and everything below it need only two operations from the
execution layer: fetch a query's rows, and ask when the cache entries backing
them were written. ``Executor`` provides both (and satisfies this Protocol
structurally, with no changes of its own), but it is not the only possible
provider: replaying a recorded board from a serialized artifact has rows on
hand and no warehouse to reach.

Typing the render path against this Protocol rather than the concrete
``Executor`` is what makes such a provider a type-checked participant instead of
a duck-typed stand-in smuggled past an annotation. It is also a step toward the
boundary ``core/AGENTS.md`` commits to — render as a pure function of
``(Resolved*, data)`` plus foreign-format translation.

**Deliberately absent**, because the post-resolve path does not use them:

- ``adapter_registry`` — only the *resolve* path reaches for it
  (``render/chart/auto_link.py``, ``render/layout_sizing.py::_require_resolved``).
  Auto-link bakes its result into ``resolved.link`` at resolve time, so a
  replayed board already carries its links. Adding it here would oblige every
  provider to own a live warehouse connection, defeating the point.
- ``board`` — the one read (``executor.board.variables`` in
  ``execute/chart_resolution.py``) is resolve-path only.
- ``execute_chart`` / ``is_cached`` — the resolve path, the terminal and
  data-format renderers, and the ``render()`` orchestrator's cache pre-pass.

Keep this Protocol minimal. Widening it to accommodate a new render-time reach
into the execution layer is the signal that the reach itself belongs earlier, on
the resolve path, where the value can be baked into ``Resolved*``.
