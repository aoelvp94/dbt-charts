"""Pluggable cache-backend Protocol for query result storage.

Stage: EXECUTE (Cache)
Purpose: Define the abstract surface that any query-result cache backend must
implement. The current implementations are TrivialDuckDBCache (local) and
PostgresResultCache (Cloud). Future alternatives (Redis, S3, in-memory) can
plug in by satisfying this Protocol.

Cache keys are always (source_hash, query_hash, variables_hash):
  - source_hash  — stable identity of the data source (connection string, project, etc.)
  - query_hash   — hash of the SQL/query after static resolution
  - variables_hash — hash of the variables that materially affect the result

board_slug and query_name are METADATA, not key components. They are passed
as keyword-only arguments to put for snapshot history.

One entry per key holds **two slots** — the last successful run's rows and the
last error. Either may be empty. That is the two-table shape, moved onto one
row, and the move is what fixes the bugs: a success write clears the error slot
*in the same statement*, so a stale failure can no longer outlive the success
that superseded it, and there is no cross-store bookkeeping to leak. The two
writes touch disjoint columns, so concurrent renders cannot clobber each other
and nothing needs locking.

Read order is rows-first: a caller still inside its own ttl is never handed a
failure for data it is entitled to, even when a sibling query over the same SQL
failed a moment ago. Only when the rows are too old *for this caller* does the
error slot answer.

Freshness is **derived on read, never stored**. The entry records only when it
was written; each caller decides whether that is fresh enough:

- **Rows** are live while no older than the *reader's* resolved
  ``CachePolicy.ttl_timedelta``, passed to ``get``.
- An **error** is live while inside its backend's retry window — a constant,
  not a reader policy, because a transient warehouse blip must be re-tried in
  minutes no matter how long the query is willing to serve stale rows. Each
  backend still spells that window itself (``failure_ttl_seconds`` here,
  ``_FAILURE_TTL_SECONDS`` in Cloud), unchanged and un-unified by this merge;
  routing both through engine config is open work, not something this claims.

Storing an expiry on the row would be wrong, not merely redundant: the key is
content-addressed (source + SQL + variables) and **deliberately excludes the
cache policy**, so two queries with identical SQL and different ``cache:``
blocks share one entry. A stored expiry would let whichever ran last silently
govern the other's authored freshness contract. The row cannot own an expiry
because the row is not owned by one policy.

Backend selection: TrivialDuckDBCache (local) and PostgresResultCache (Cloud)
implement this today. A future DCT_CACHE_BACKEND env-var hook can route to
other alternatives. This Protocol is also the seam for a future
`pip install dbt-charts[duckdb]` extras-packaging effort.

        One lookup, because there is one entry: a rows miss is never followed
        by a second probe for an error.

        *ttl* is the **reader's** resolved ``CachePolicy.ttl_timedelta`` and
        bounds a rows outcome only: the entry must be no older than *ttl*.
        ``None`` means the reader imposes no age bound — ``ttl: forever``, or a
        content-addressed lookup with no time dimension. It is ignored for an
        error outcome, whose retry window is a backend constant the reader has
        no say in.

        Passing the reader's ttl here is load-bearing, not optional: the cache
        key excludes the cache policy, so two queries with identical SQL and
        different ``cache:`` blocks share one entry. A caller that omits *ttl*
        gets whatever the other query last wrote, however old.

        The write timestamp travels with the hit (see ``CacheHit``) so a caller
        that also wants "data as of <time>" (the executor, for board-chrome)
        never needs a second round trip.

        **Type fidelity is part of the contract, scoped to uniformly-typed
        columns.** ``int``/``bool``/``str``/``float`` always stay themselves.
        A column whose every non-None value across the whole rowset shares
        one of ``date``, ``datetime`` (naive stays naive, aware stays aware),
        or ``Decimal`` must round-trip exactly — not a stringified or
        float-coerced stand-in — even through a backend whose storage is
        lossy on its own (e.g. JSON, which has no date/datetime/Decimal
        type, or DuckDB's fixed-precision DECIMAL): such a backend must carry
        enough metadata alongside the rows to restore the original type on
        read. See ``PostgresResultCache`` for the reference implementation
        (a per-column type tag stored beside the rows) and
        ``TrivialDuckDBCache`` (a sidecar VARCHAR column for uniformly-
        Decimal columns, since DuckDB's DECIMAL is too narrow for some
        warehouse NUMERIC precisions). A column that mixes types — including
        mixing ``date`` and ``datetime`` in the same column — is NOT
        promised exact fidelity: its values pass through in whatever form
        the backend's own storage naturally holds (e.g. an ISO string),
        never guessed back into a type from their shape. Restoration
        failure on a value a backend's own tag claims to be able to restore
        (a corrupted entry, or code-version skew) must be treated as a
        miss — ``get()`` never raises and never returns partially-restored
        rows.

        **Column order is part of the contract too.** Each row mapping must
        come back with its keys in the order ``put()`` stored them: a query
        result's column order is part of its shape, and a table's rendered
        columns are read straight off ``rows[0].keys()``. A backend whose
        storage does not preserve mapping key order — Postgres ``jsonb`` sorts
        object keys, and most key-value stores promise nothing — must either
        store in a form that does, or record the column list alongside the rows
        and rebuild each row from it on read, the same way the type map above is
        carried. ``TrivialDuckDBCache`` gets column order from its result
        table's own declared columns, but derives those columns from the first
        row alone — so it honours this only when every row in one ``put()``
        shares a key set, and a heterogeneous batch loses keys the first row
        lacked.

        Callers of ``get()`` (the executor's incremental-tail watermark
        computation, in particular) trust this and do not guess a value's
        real type from its shape; a backend that violates it — including a
        mixed-typed key column, whose values are not promised to be
        comparable — produces a type disagreement the executor's merge step
        raises on, rather than a silently wrong result.

        dicts, and one that does must not apply its own storage encodings
