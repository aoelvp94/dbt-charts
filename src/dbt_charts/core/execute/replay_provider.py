"""Serve a board's recorded rows back, with no warehouse.

A resolved-board artifact plus the rows it was rendered against is enough to
re-render that board exactly: the post-resolve render path asks only for rows
and cache timestamps (see ``chart_data_provider``). This provider answers
both from a recording, so a replayed render opens no connection and runs no
query.

Every unknown becomes an error rather than a plausible-looking default. A board
is a claim about data; serving it with silently-empty rows, or with rows captured
under different variable values, produces something that looks right and is
wrong — the failure mode this codebase treats as worse than a crash.
