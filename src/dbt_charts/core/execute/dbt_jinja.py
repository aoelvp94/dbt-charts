"""Shared dbt Jinja patterns.

Single source of truth for both *detecting* dbt-specific Jinja calls (ref(),
source()) and *rewriting* them into relation names. Detection routes queries
between DbtAdapter and SqlAdapter and gates the manifest requirement;
substitution is what DbtRefResolver runs once a manifest is in hand.

Detection accepts strictly more than substitution rewrites, and always will:
`_DBT_REF_RE` matches the `{{ ref(` prefix — that is what routing needs — while
`REF_CALL_RE` has to parse a whole call to know what relation to write. No amount
of shared pattern-building closes a gap between a prefix matcher and a parser.

So the gap is closed downstream instead of asserted here: after substitution,
`resolve_dbt_refs_with_provenance` re-runs `has_dbt_jinja` on its own output and
raises ERR-DBT-CALL-UNSUPPORTED on anything left over. That covers every argument
spelling, present and future, rather than the list the patterns happen to know.
Widening the patterns below shrinks what that check rejects; it is not a
precondition for the check being sound.

The substitution patterns cover:
  - Delimiter spacing:  {{ ref( … ) }} and {{ref(…)}}
  - Whitespace trim:    {{- ref( … ) -}}, either delimiter, with or without space
  - Argument spacing:   {{ ref( 'orders' ) }}, {{ source('s' , 't') }}
  - Either quote style: 'orders' and "orders"

Deliberately not covered — each resolves to a guess, so each raises instead:
package-qualified `ref('pkg', 'orders')` (the manifest lookup does not scope by
package, so ignoring the package would pick whichever same-named model came
first), versioned `ref('orders', v=2)`, and any macro-computed argument.
