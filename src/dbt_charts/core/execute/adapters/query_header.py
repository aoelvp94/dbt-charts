"""The dbt-side transport for query attribution.

Stage: EXECUTE

dbt reads two *independent* members off a connection manager's ``query_header``:

- ``add(sql)`` — via ``BaseConnectionManager._add_query_comment``, which every
  adapter's ``add_query`` calls. This is the universal comment path.
- ``comment.query_comment`` — dbt-bigquery's ``get_labels_from_query_comment`` reads
  this *attribute*, JSON-parses it, and passes the result to
  ``QueryJobConfig(labels=...)``. It never parses the SQL it emits.

Driving them separately is the point: BigQuery takes structured job labels while its
query text stays byte-identical, and every other warehouse — none of which has a
structured mechanism to lose — takes the comment.

The payload itself is built in ``core/attribution.py``, which stays free of any dbt
import so the compile layer can share its vocabulary.

    Holds no attribution of its own. One header serves every query on a pooled
    connection, and a pool is shared by every source with the same connection
