"""Postgres connections that read outside a transaction.

Stage: EXECUTE

psycopg2 opens a transaction on the first statement of a non-autocommit connection,
and a dbt charts read never commits — ``auto_begin=False`` only stops *dbt* from opening
one. A pooled connection therefore sat ``idle in transaction`` holding an
``AccessShareLock`` on every table it had read, blocking the ``ACCESS EXCLUSIVE`` that
a dbt table rebuild takes, until the pool was closed.

dbt-postgres grew an ``autocommit`` credential in 1.11, but this package supports 1.10
as well, where an ``autocommit`` key is silently dropped on the way to the driver. So
the setting goes on the psycopg2 handle itself, where no adapter version can ignore it.
Every other warehouse we build already reads outside a transaction: dbt-redshift,
dbt-snowflake and dbt-trino open autocommit connections, and BigQuery, Databricks and
Spark have no session transaction to leave open.
