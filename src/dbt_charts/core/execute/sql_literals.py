"""SQL literal inlining for dbt-adapter execution paths.

dbt adapter.execute() accepts plain SQL only — no parameterized queries.
This module provides functions for inlining positional $N params or named
dialect-specific params as properly escaped SQL literals.

Escaping here is the last line of defense, not the only one. Values reaching
these functions include runtime variable values, which originate as user input;
that is what the quoting is for. Identifiers — column and table names — must be
validated before they arrive, since quoting a value cannot make an injected
identifier safe.

Which characters have to be escaped is a property of the engine that parses
the literal, not of the placeholder style it was rendered in, so every entry
point takes that engine and none of them defaults it. An omitted argument
would be indistinguishable from asking for no escaping — a call site could
then quietly opt out of the control, which is how a live injection once
survived the round that fixed it.

    When rendering and inlining are two halves of one round trip that never

    warehouse's own syntax is not. `$1` and `?` occur in ordinary SQL (money
    strings, URLs with a query string), and once the renderer has emitted a
    placeholder of the same shape, nothing downstream can tell the two apart:
    the substitution either runs off the end of the parameter list or splices a
    value into the middle of somebody's string literal. NUL cannot appear in
    authored SQL, so this style collides with nothing.

    `uses_named_params` here means only "each index has its own placeholder, so
    match it whole rather than by pattern" — that is what routes flattening to
    inline_dialect_params. It does not promise the dict-shaped binding the base
    class describes, and must not be read that way if binding is ever added:
