"""Per-project URL→board alias index for redirect resolution.

Builds a URL→canonical-board-file-path mapping from all board files in a project.
Used by the HTTP server to 30x-redirect alias URLs to the board's real path.

Design invariants (from accepted decisions):
- Aliases must be absolute (leading /).
- URLs are trailing-slash-canonical and percent-decoded before matching.
- An alias colliding with a real file path is a hard build-time error.
- Two boards claiming the same alias is a hard build-time error.
- Aliasing a generated system view (data/inspector route) is allowed (override).
- The index is strictly per-project.
