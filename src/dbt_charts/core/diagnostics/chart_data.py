"""ChartDataError: chart received data that doesn't match its requirements.

Lives in core (not render) so compile-time chart-data validation can raise
it without compile depending on render. Does not subclass render's
``RenderError`` — that would put core back on top of render — but mirrors
its message-formatting and error-code-defaulting behavior directly against
``DbtChartsError``.
