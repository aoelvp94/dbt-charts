A refusal decided here — no credential, an unreachable host, a repository that
backs two projects — is as real to a caller as one the server sent, so all of
them answer ``as_api_error()`` and reach an agent as the same ``{code, message,
field_errors}`` body. The alternative, two failure vocabularies depending on how
far the request got, means every client parses both.

Nothing in this module imports the rest of the package: the config and HTTP
