"""The user-level config the ``dct cloud`` verbs read.

Auth is user-global and context is per-invocation (the initiative's spec), so
one file outside any project holds the credential, the host, and the default
org/project ``dct cloud use`` writes. It sits where the platform puts user
config — ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/dbt-charts/`` (``~/.config/dbt-charts/`` when that
is unset), ``%APPDATA%\\dbt-charts\\`` on Windows — and is written 0600, because
the token is in it.

The token comes from ``dct cloud login`` (the OAuth device grant), from
``DCT_CLOUD_TOKEN``, or from a hand-written ``token:`` line in this file;
every verb that needs one says so when it is missing.
