"""Where a project is published in Cloud, recorded in the project's own
``dbt_charts.yml`` -- the one piece of Cloud state that otherwise lives only
in Cloud's database. ``published_to:`` is written by ``dct cloud project
connect`` (``cli/commands/cloud.py``) and read first by context resolution
(``cloud_client.context``), before it falls back to matching the git remote.

``dbt_charts.cloud_client`` may import no other first-party dbt_charts module
(``tach.toml``), so the filesystem walks here -- finding a repository's
``.git``, finding the nearest ``dbt_charts.yml`` -- are self-contained rather
than reused from ``core.project_roots``.

Everything here raises ``ValueError`` and nothing else: every ``dct cloud``
verb resolves through ``resolve_published_to`` now, and a half-edited
``dbt_charts.yml`` is a routine transient state that must reach the user as
this CLI's one failure output rather than as a traceback.
