    The caller owns the project instance. Pair this with

    ``ProjectSession.open(project_dir, cache=...)`` — ``open()`` builds its own
    project from the path, so composing it with this function constructs two.

    Precedence: ``no_cache=True`` (the CLI's ``--no-cache``) skips the cache
    entirely; ``cache_path`` (``--cache PATH``, or its ``DCT_CACHE_PATH`` env
    backing) opens that persistent file. Otherwise the project's
    ``dbt_charts.yml`` ``cache:`` block picks the location — a configured ``path``
    opens that file (created if absent); no path opens the zero-config
    in-memory default. A project-level ``cache: false`` defaults the *cascade*
    to off without closing the door on a nearer scope's opt-in, so it still
    opens a store; the resolved per-query policy decides what gets written.

    Yields:
        ``None`` only when ``no_cache=True`` — callers pass this straight
        through as ``ProjectSession(cache=...)``.
