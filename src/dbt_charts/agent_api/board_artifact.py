"""Emit a resolved-board artifact + recording, and render one back.

`emit_board_artifact` compiles, resolves, and executes a board, then writes the
board's published `ResolvedBoard` contract and a data sidecar (the rows it was
resolved against). `render_board_from_files` reads both back and renders
without a compile step or a warehouse connection — the "skip the
compilation" win the resolved-board artifact exists for.

Business logic (the resolve/record/dump/load primitives) lives in
`dbt_charts.core.execute.recording` and `dbt_charts.core.render.board_replay`;
this module wires them to a `Project` + `AdapterRegistry` and to plain
filesystem paths for the artifact/recording files, which are generated
build outputs rather than project (board YAML) content.
