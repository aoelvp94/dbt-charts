"""General project-file tools for the chat agent.

Claude-Code-style primitives — read, write, edit, glob, grep — that let an
agent author and save boards directly, rather than via a domain-specific
"write a dashboard" verb. The agent composes these with the typed dct tools
(``validate_board``, ``render_board``, ``schema``, ``execute_query``).

Every path is resolved against and confined to the project root. A path that
escapes the root (``..`` traversal, absolute path outside, symlink out) is
refused — these tools never touch the wider filesystem.
