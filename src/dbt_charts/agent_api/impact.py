"""Column → boards reverse index: which boards break if this column changes.

A dbt author about to rename ``orders.customer_id`` asks one question — which
dashboards depend on it. The forward direction (validate every board, read the
errors) inverts that question and only answers it *after* the rename breaks
things; this index answers it before, from compiled board SQL alone, with no
warehouse connection.

Boards whose column set cannot be determined (a ``SELECT *``, unparseable
SQL, a board that fails compile) are returned as *indeterminate*, never
omitted — a board missing from an impact list reads as "safe to rename".
