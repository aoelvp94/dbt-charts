"""Expand ``{{ s_<key> }}`` macros in wheel skill bodies.

Skill markdown is authored once with ``{{ s_<key> }}`` tokens. On the shared
tool-call surface the ``tool`` side of the alias renders; on the CLI surface
(``dct skills``, ``get_skill``/``list_skills`` called with ``surface="cli"``)
the ``dct`` side renders. A third surface, ``install``, renders only when a
skill is written to disk by ``dct init skills``: the one place a skill's
bare registry name (``board-build``) becomes its ``dct-``-prefixed on-disk
name (``dct-board-build``). ``cli`` stays bare so ``dct skills <name>``
resolves what it prints. The alias table lives in ``surface_aliases.yaml``
next to this module so every wheel skill and every surface points at the
same source of truth.

Skills that should never appear on one surface (e.g. ``mcp-setup`` is
CLI-only) declare ``surfaces:`` in their frontmatter; the registry hides them
from the wrong surface entirely. Skills shown on both surfaces use ``{{ s_key }}``
wherever they reference a tool/command so the prose reads naturally to both
audiences.

Board-YAML template tokens such as ``{{ region }}`` (no ``s_`` prefix) pass
through untouched — the regex only matches the ``s_`` prefix.
