"""Host-agnostic inbound-link scanning for move_file.

Scans the boards tree for references to a dashboard slug -- ``link:`` chart
fields and markdown link targets -- so a move can rewrite what it can prove
is a reference and report the rest. A first-class internal-link graph is out
of scope here (a likely-separate dft-core initiative); this is a narrow,
best-effort heuristic: exact syntactic matches are rewritten, everything else
(the slug's basename appearing in prose, without recognized link syntax) is
reported as a fuzzy hit and never touched.
