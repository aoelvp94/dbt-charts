"""Tests for the AREA_UNSTACKED_READS_AS_STACKED render-warning detector.

Detection rule: fires on an area chart that resolves to an unstacked mode
(``stack`` None or "none"), paints two or more series (from either a
``color:`` column or a wide ``y: [a, b, c]`` measure list), AND no pair of
those series ever CROSSES -- order-free: the pair's largest gap with `a`
above `b`, and its largest gap with `b` above `a`, must BOTH clear a
discernibility threshold (a fraction of the y-domain span) for the pair to
count as crossed. Whether a pair crosses needs only x *identity* to line up
`a(x)` against `b(x)`; it is never a question about the ORDER a chart paints
its x's in, so this detector never sorts x values, never resolves a Vega-Lite
x type, and never reads a baked plot height.

dbt charts already signals stacking through fill weight -- an unstacked
area's fill is translucent, a stacked one's is solid -- so the real hazard is
a chart that defeats that cue anyway: series that never cross paint one band
nested inside the next at every x, indistinguishable from a real stack. A
pair that crosses declares itself an overlap, so it never fires regardless of
series count.

Suppression is not tested here. It is applied centrally by
``diagnostics/suppression.py::partition`` after every detector has run, and is
covered by ``test_suppression.py`` -- a per-detector copy would only re-test
``partition``.
