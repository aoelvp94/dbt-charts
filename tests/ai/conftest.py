# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# OpenAI's Structured Outputs / strict function-calling schema validator only
# accepts this fixed allowlist for string "format" — anything else (e.g. the
# "path" pydantic emits for pathlib.Path fields) is a 400 at request time,
# rejecting the whole tools array before any tool is ever called.

# checked separately against the allowlist above); everything else is a
# structural keyword confirmed either by OpenAI's docs (`type`, `properties`,
# `required`, `additionalProperties`, `items`, `$ref`, `$defs`, `anyOf`,
# `enum`, `description`, `title`) or by a live API call against our own
# schemas (`default`, `minimum`, `maximum` on the `limit` fields — the docs
# call these unsupported, current behavior disagrees, see
# apps/evals/tests/e2e/test_openai_tool_schema_acceptance.py). A keyword
# outside this set is unverified: it may be silently accepted, silently
# ignored, or a 400 like #7013's `format: "path"` was — flagging it forces
# that to be checked against a live call before it ships.
