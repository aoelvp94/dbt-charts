"""Wire-contract tests for OpenAIAdapter.stream_with_tools.

Pins the Responses-API request shape so a silent regression in how the adapter
threads tool results is caught here — not two weeks later in a slow, flaky e2e.
This is the legitimate parity-test carve-out: the contract lives across two
genuinely separate surfaces (adapter -> gateway), not a duplicated helper.

The adapter is tested against a fake :class:`ResponsesGateway` that plays the
gateway's post-parsing role directly (it hands back typed `GatewayEvent`s, the
same as the real one) — the SDK-facing wire parsing/error/usage/early-stop
behavior these tests used to pin now lives at the gateway and is tested in
``test_openai_gateway.py``.
