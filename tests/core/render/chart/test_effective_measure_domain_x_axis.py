"""Pins ``effective_measure_domain``'s reduction on an unauthored x-axis.

Unlike y, resolve never bakes ``domain_min``/``domain_max`` or a zero-anchor
floor for x (no ``resolve_measure_x_scale`` exists, and the smart-zero
heuristic only ever runs against the y column). So on x the function reduces
to "authored domain, else the data extent" — exactly what Vega-Lite auto-fits
an unpinned axis to. This is the fact the quantitative-x zero rule
(``BaselineFeature._apply_x_threshold``) depends on; a future x-side headroom bake
that silently starts populating ``domain_min``/``domain_max`` for x would
change this reduction, and this test would catch it because it resolves a
real scatter chart through ``resolve()`` -> ``plan_cartesian()`` ->
``build_cartesian_axes()`` -- the same path a chart takes at render time --
rather than constructing the axis by hand.
