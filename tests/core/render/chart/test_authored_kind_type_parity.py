"""Parity gate: every resolved chart family's painted headline run carries a
resolvable ``data-authored-kind`` leaf marker.

This is the test that should have caught the table gap before it shipped
(``table.py``'s title/subtitle runs painted no marker at all, so a table's
title only ever selected the chart for the Design panel — inline edit never
opened, unlike the same gesture on a bar chart). Building it surfaced two more
instances of the identical gap, fixed alongside it: ``callout.py``'s title and
``spark_bar.py``'s title/subtitle. KPI needed no fix — its label run already
carried the marker.

The type set iterated is not a hand list: it is introspected directly off the
``ResolvedChart`` discriminated union, so a newly registered chart family is
picked up automatically and must be accounted for in ``_NO_PAINTED_TITLE``
(explicitly declaring "this family paints no title text at all") or it will
fail here until someone declares an expectation for it.
