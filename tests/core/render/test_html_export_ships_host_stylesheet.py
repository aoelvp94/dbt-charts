"""A static HTML export ships the host stylesheet even with no runtime.

The board carries no interaction of its own (a board is a picture), so the page
around it must: a static export is still a browser page with real `<a href>`
links, a text cursor and a hover underline. Without the stylesheet the inert
cell text catches the pointer and a row's link is unreachable from its own
values. Only the runtime is gated on a host that can act on it.
