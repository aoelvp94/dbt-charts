"""Regression tests: a focused chart renders at its dashboard slot width.

`chart_focus` (and `focus_on_chart()`) builds a single-chart board. Before the
fix, that board sized the chart from the theme family `preferred_width`, so the
focused render's geometry (band widths, axis-label fit) diverged from what the
chart looked like on its dashboard. The focused board must instead pin the slot
width the dashboard layout assigns to the chart, so focusing is WYSIWYG.

A chart that is defined but not placed in any layout has no dashboard slot, so
its focused render keeps the preferred-width behavior.
