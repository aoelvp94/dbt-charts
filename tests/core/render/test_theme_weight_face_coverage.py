"""Regression guard: every weight a built-in theme cascades onto a vendored
variable family must have a matching static face in ``fonts.WEIGHT_FACE_ALIASES``.

vl-convert cannot bind a variable font's ``wght`` axis from a numeric
``font-weight`` request (see fonts/README.md "Select figure style by family",
weight section) — a family/weight pair with no row there silently renders as
Regular in every PNG/PDF export. This test walks the resolved style tree of
every production theme and fails the moment one starts cascading a weight
outside the currently-covered closed set, instead of that showing up as a
quiet visual regression in an export nobody diffed.

"-extreme" diagnostic themes intentionally probe out-of-range values by design
(their own YAML files document this) and are excluded — a face author who
explicitly opts into one accepts the fallback.
