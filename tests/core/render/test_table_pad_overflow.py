"""Regression: a cell whose text is deeper than its column's format precision.

`measure_column_demands` applied a column's `decimal_pad_table` to every cell's
rendered text unconditionally, including text `format_table_cell_value` produced
by falling through to `str(value)` because the value was not float-parseable.
That text owes nothing to the column's format, so its fractional depth can
exceed what the pad table was built for, and `decimal_pad_for` raises
`IndexError` -- surfacing as `ERR-INTERNAL` and taking down every chart on the
board, not just the offending table.

Both paint sites gate the pad on the full shape -- numeric, not bool, and not
date-like -- and pad the number lane alone rather than the whole rendered cell.
Measure did none of that. Measure must mirror paint or the column is
mis-measured, so the fix aligns it to that same predicate and that same string.
