"""A default-less multiselect must not take the board down at render time.

The regression this pins is `render()`'s own variable merge, not a helper: the
merge seeds every registered variable to `None`, `variable_defaults` only carries
the ones with a non-`None` default, and markdown/title Jinja reads that dict
directly. So a `multiselect` with no `default:` reached a template as `None`, and
`{{ v | join(', ') }}` raised `TypeError` → `ERR-INTERNAL` → the whole board, not
one tile.

Tests here go through `dbt_charts.core.render.render` deliberately. A test that
narrows the values itself before calling a renderer would pass while the shipped
path crashed — that is exactly how this defect survived its first fix.
