"""Does the memo actually make a render faster? Measure it, don't assume it.

Marked ``slow`` so it stays out of ``just test`` and out of CI's default
lanes — a wall-clock ratio is the wrong thing to gate a merge on. Run it by hand
when you touch the memo, or from a nightly:

    uv run pytest dbt-charts/tests/core/render/test_svg_cache_benchmark.py -m slow -s

``-s`` shows the per-arm milliseconds; the assertion itself is a deliberately
loose floor, because the honest claim is "vl-convert is most of render compute
and this skips it", not any particular multiple on any particular machine.
