"""Re-render a board from an artifact plus a recording, with no warehouse.

This is the end-to-end claim of the resolved-board artifact: a serialized
``ResolvedBoard`` and the rows it was rendered against are together sufficient to
reproduce the board, with no YAML compile and no database connection.

The comparison normalizes Vega's clip-path ids. Those come from a
process-global counter, so the same chart rendered twice in one process gets
``clip1`` the first time and ``clip7`` the second — a pre-existing render
nondeterminism unrelated to artifact fidelity. Everything else must match
exactly; the normalization is deliberately narrow so a real difference cannot
hide behind it.
