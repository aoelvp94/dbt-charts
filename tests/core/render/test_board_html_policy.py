"""Tests for the board-level html_policy field.

When html_policy is set on a board, the body text rendering is governed by the
tier:
- "none" (default): HTML in text is escaped / rendered as plain markdown.
- "safe-subset": fails closed — no foreignObject.
- "trusted-raw": HTML in text IS rendered via foreignObject (mdsvg's
  allow_raw_html=True path), sanitized by nh3. TRUSTED-CONTENT ONLY.

Covers:
- html_policy="none" (default): HTML in text is NOT rendered via foreignObject.
- html_policy="safe-subset": HTML in text is NOT rendered via foreignObject
  (fail-closed).
- html_policy="trusted-raw": HTML in text IS rendered via foreignObject.
- Model round-trip: authored YAML html_policy -> normalized Board -> ResolvedBoard.
- Reflected-XSS regression: a viewer-controlled variable interpolated on its
  own line does not produce event handlers in rendered output.
- Ceiling render: DCT_HTML_POLICY_CEILING=safe-subset prevents foreignObject
  even when the board explicitly requests trusted-raw.
