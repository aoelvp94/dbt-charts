"""Which rendered surface carries font bytes, and which keeps ``/static/fonts/`` URLs.

The split is the whole design, so it is pinned here rather than left to be inferred:

- ``format="html"`` with ``standalone=True`` — what ``dct render`` writes — carries the
  bytes, because nothing serves the file it lands in.
- Every live host (``format="html"`` without the flag) keeps the URLs. It is serving
  ``/static/fonts/`` itself, and inlining would put ~0.5 MiB of base64 into every
  page view for no benefit.
- ``format="svg"`` follows the same rule as html, because it is what ``dct render``
  writes by default and a ``.svg`` opened from disk needs its fonts just as much. The
  visual goldens render through ``format="svg"`` as well but never set the flag, which
  is what keeps the golden tree free of payloads.
- ``png``/``pdf`` never embed. They go through resvg, which binds fonts from the
  registered directory and never reads ``@font-face``.

Also pinned: the bytes appear once per board. An exported page used to declare the
whole block twice — once from ``page.css`` and once inside the board SVG's own
``<style>`` — which is a doubled payload the moment those URLs become data URIs.

    finds when there are few braces to stop it — and a table of numbers offers
    thousands of dots. It tripped the 30s suite timeout in CI, not a benchmark, so
    the guard here is the same: a decimal-heavy table board that renders inside the
    ordinary timeout, with the right boards. No hand-written millisecond bound, which
    would only add a flake.
