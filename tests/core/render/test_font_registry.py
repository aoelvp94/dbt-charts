"""Structural guards on the vendored font registry.

``FONT_REGISTRY`` is the single home for family → file. These tests keep it honest:
the files it names exist, the stylesheet the browser downloads is generated from it
rather than hand-maintained beside it, and the set of families we measure but never
serve stays an explicit, argued-for list instead of quietly growing.

The pristine Noto Emoji source hash pin is intentionally not covered
here, since it pins a design-experiment copy outside dbt-charts/.
