"""Board titles must not leak typography across boards sharing one HTML page.

Inline SVG has no style scope: when two boards' SVGs land in one HTML
document (the docs themes page, or any Cloud/embed surface stacking more
than one board), their `<style>` blocks are both document-global. Before
mdsvg scoped its `.md-*` class names to a hash of their own style, every
board emitted the same literal `.md-heading` selector, so the last board's
rule won for every title on the page regardless of its own theme.

This reproduces that scenario at the board level: two boards on different
themes, concatenated the way an HTML page would, asserting their heading
rules carry distinct selectors.
