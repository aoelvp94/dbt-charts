"""X-axis tick values must cover the full scale domain, not the base's rows.

When an overlay layer carries more x buckets than the base series (a forward
goal ramp running past actuals, say), Vega-Lite unions the layer domains and
the band scale grows to hold every bucket. ``axis.values`` was derived from
``ordinal_axis_values(data, x_field)`` over the BASE series' rows alone, so the
bands past the base's last row got no label.

Nothing here covers the separate width-dependent symptom (Vega dropping the
leading label at isolated plot widths, present again half a pixel to either
side). Measured against this same chart, that fires identically whether
``values`` lists 8 bands or all 13, with ``labelOverlap`` false or true, and
with a one-word label as readily as a two-part one — so it is a Vega layout
bug, not a consequence of the truncated list, and no assertion here can hold
it. See the task brief for the upstream repro.

``values`` is not decorative: it carries the month -> quarter -> year label
cadence ladder. The fix derives it from the full domain and then thins, so the
thinning assertions here are as load-bearing as the coverage ones.
