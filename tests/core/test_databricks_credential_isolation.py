"""Deterministic repro of the Databricks per-tenant credential race.

``DatabricksConnectionManager.open`` is a ``@classmethod`` that writes the
class-level ``cls.credentials_manager`` (``creds.authenticate()``, connections.py
line 479) and then reads it straight back to build the connection arguments
(``SqlUtils.prepare_connection_arguments(creds, cls.credentials_manager, ...)``,
line 487-488), with no lock between the write and the read. Two tenants opening
connections concurrently in one process interleave between the write and the read,
so one tenant's connection arguments are assembled from the *other* tenant's
credential manager — a cross-tenant credential leak.

This drives the real installed ``open()`` (reached through ``build_adapter`` and
the adapter's connection manager). The interleave is forced deterministically with
``threading.Event``s rather than a sleep race: the only statement between the
write (479) and the read (488) is ``QueryConfigUtils.get_merged_query_tags`` (line
485, reached because each connection carries a query-header context), so that call
is the real preemption point — we patch it to park tenant A there until tenant B
has completed its own write, clobbering the shared class var. No live Databricks
endpoint is touched: the network connect is stubbed and
``prepare_connection_arguments`` is patched only to record which credential-manager
identity each thread actually saw at the read.
