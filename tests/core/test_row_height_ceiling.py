"""End-to-end: an authored row `height:` is a ceiling, not a floor.

Settled 2026-08-07: when a row's content resolves shorter than its authored height, the row
shrinks to the content. The authored height still drives the content's own
resolution — a chart given room to use it may use it — it simply stops being
the row's own allocated height when the content didn't use all of it.

These tests run the full ``compile()`` -> ``render()`` pipeline and assert on
the emitted SVG (board ``viewBox`` height, tile ``data-chart-height``) rather
than an intermediate sizing structure — the bug lived in how the sizing pass's
per-item height fed the render pass's nested-board floor
(``render_nested_board``'s ``max(natural_board_height, allocated_board_height)``
in ``render/boards.py``), so only the emitted SVG proves the fix reaches it.

Assertions are relative (authored-ceiling case vs. natural-content case)
rather than pinned to exact theme-derived pixel constants — see
``dataface/AGENTS.md`` "Don't pin theme/default values in tests."
