"""An axis tick reads at the same weight as the gridline it shares a position with.

A tick and its gridline mark the same value and are read as one mechanism
crossing the axis line. Nothing couples them: ``axis_x``, ``axis_y``, and
``axis_quantitative`` each carry ``SkipInheritSlots()``, so a theme that
overrides ``axis.grid`` without touching ``axis.ticks`` beside it silently
splits the pair into two weights.

Cases go through the chart-type patch (Layer 4) as well as the theme slots,
because that layer is where the per-family grid weights live — a bare slot
pairing would assert on a combination no chart actually renders.

Scope: ``AXIS_ROLES`` pins the family/channel pairings that carry the drift this
module guards, not every channel type a family accepts. Two combinations outside
it fail today on the four themes that never overrode ``axis.grid`` — a line on a
quantitative x, and a scatter on a temporal x — from a pre-existing mismatch
between ``_base.yaml``'s ``axis_quantitative.ticks.width`` and the ``axis_x`` /
scatter grid widths. That drift predates this guard and is not what it covers.

These assert relationships between resolved fields, never a hex or a px — theme
values stay tunable.
