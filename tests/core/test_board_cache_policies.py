"""`BoardRenderResult.board_query_data_ages` covers every query behind the board.

Cloud is the consumer: it derives expires_at anchored on each query's actual
data age (data_as_of + ttl). A query missing from the list is invisible to
that computation. The list has to reflect all queries executed, including
inline chart queries, `#`-anchored refs, and layer queries.
