"""Regression tests for Executor cache wiring.

Covers:
- Executor with DuckDB failure cache: adapter not called on cache hit

DCT_CACHE_PATH env-var wiring now lives entirely at the CLI/Typer boundary
(--cache PATH, envvar=DCT_CACHE_PATH); core no longer reads the environment
directly, so there is nothing to test at this layer.

The render_dashboard entry point's own cache wiring (forwarded to Executor
unchanged, never closed by the callee) is covered in
dbt-charts/tests/agent_api/test_dashboards.py::TestRenderDashboardDiagnostics
(test_render_dashboard_threads_result_cache_to_executor,
test_render_dashboard_does_not_close_result_cache) — this module no longer
duplicates that coverage now that compile_and_render is deleted.
