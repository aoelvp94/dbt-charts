"""Migration test for the 0.5.0 -> current KpiTonesStyle Move.

``style.charts.kpi.tones`` moved to board-level ``style.tones`` (a sibling of
``style.palettes``) — declared as a ``Move`` in
``compile/migrations/versions/current.py``. An authored board (or theme
patch) using the pre-move path migrates transparently; ``style.color`` (the
other change in the same task) has no Move — its tail collides with the live
``style.color`` on every other chart family, so it fails loud instead (see
``current.py``'s module docstring).

The Move covers exactly two positions: the root-anchored
``style.charts.kpi.tones`` and the per-tab
``tabs.items.*.style.charts.kpi.tones`` (a tab's own ``style:`` override).
Any ``rows``/``cols``/``grid.items.*.item`` self-nesting below the root is
uncovered — ``_relative_field_paths`` checks its ``seen`` ancestor set on
entry, so a self-referential model's fields are never walked a second time
along the same path (see ``current.py``'s module docstring for the full
rationale and what remains uncovered).

``migrate_mapping`` (in-memory, used when compiling/loading an old board)
relocates the whole ``tones:`` mapping regardless of its shape — ``Move``
pops and re-places the raw value found at ``old_path``. ``migrate_yaml_text``
(the ``dct migrate`` text-preserving rewriter) is narrower by design — see
its own docstring — and refuses a non-scalar move to a different parent
rather than reformat the file; a board authoring the old ``tones:`` shape
must be moved by hand when run through ``dct migrate``.
