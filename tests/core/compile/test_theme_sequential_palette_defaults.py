"""Every built-in theme sets an explicit sequential palette for heatmap and
geoshape gradient color, instead of inheriting `_base.yaml`'s raw `blues`
Vega scheme.

Regression: measured contrast of `blues`'s light end against cream's canvas
was 1.08:1 — well under WCAG's 3:1 floor, so low-value heatmap cells were
effectively invisible on cream. `neon` overrode to raw `viridis` (a rainbow
scheme unrelated to its blue brand identity) with the low-end problem
inverted.

Structural, not literal: assert the resolved palette is a Dataface named
`dbt-seq-*` palette (not a raw Vega scheme like `blues`/`viridis`), not the
exact palette name — a retune of which named palette a theme picks is a
design call, not a regression (`dataface/AGENTS.md`: "Don't pin theme/default
values in tests"). Iterates `list_built_in_themes()` directly rather than a
hand-written theme list so a future `themes/foo.yaml` that forgets to
override the palette is actually caught.
