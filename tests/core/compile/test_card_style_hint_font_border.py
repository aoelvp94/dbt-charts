"""Tests for the actionable error hint on style.font / style.border for the
eight chart families with no per-chart card render surface.

bar, line, area, scatter, histogram, heatmap, pie, and donut structurally
reject style.font/style.border (extra_forbidden): they render via Vega-Lite
with no card surface distinct from the board frame, so neither field has
anywhere to paint. A bare extra_forbidden names the field but not the reason;
this hint says both.

The hint must be anchored to the slot, not merely to a path containing
``style``: ``font`` and ``border`` are among the most reused key names in the
style tree, and telling an author who typo'd ``style.axis_x.ticks.font`` to
delete the field would be worse than the generic error it replaces.
