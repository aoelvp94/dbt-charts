"""Integration tests for the 0.4.0 -> 0.5.0 KPI style.tone → support.tone ConditionalMove.

``style.tone`` was retired from KPI charts as part of the 0.5.0 release. The
frozen module ``versions/v0_5_0.py`` registers a ConditionalMove so that
authored boards from before the retirement migrate automatically when the
``support:`` block already exists; if it doesn't, ``style.tone`` is dropped and
a warning names the chart.

These tests use the real catalog and migration registry -- no synthetic data.

Callout regression: callout charts also have ``style.tone`` (a different, unrelated
field).  The ConditionalMove is scoped to ``chart_type="kpi"`` so callout boards
are never touched.
