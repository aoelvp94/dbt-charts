"""Cross-board chart import must bring its own query chain with it.

A board importing a chart via the dotted `charts.<name>` ref grammar should
not have to manually re-declare every query the chart (and its layers)
depend on, transitively, under the source board's private internal names.

The core design point, pinned explicitly below: queries are scoped
*lexically* to the source board (resolved against its own `queries:` section,
anchored at its own directory) while variables stay board-global (resolved
against the *importing* board's declared variables at execute time). That
asymmetry is the entire feature — see `compiler.py` for the design rationale.
