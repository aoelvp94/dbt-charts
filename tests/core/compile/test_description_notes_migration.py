"""Migration test for the 0.5.0 -> current description -> notes rename.

``description:`` renamed to ``notes:`` on every object carrying non-rendering
prose — declared as a ``Move`` via ``suffix_rename_moves`` in
``compile/migrations/versions/current.py``'s ``NOTES_RENAMES``.

The open-map cases are the point of this file. ``queries:``/``charts:``/
``variables:`` are open maps, so an author may legitimately *name* a query
``description`` — a bare tail rename would rewrite that identifier and leave
its ``query: description`` reference dangling. ``suffix_rename_moves``
resolves through the field tree instead, so every position carries a ``*``
segment at the open-map key level (``queries.*.description``): the key
position is never a rename target. ``test_query_named_description_*`` pin
that.
