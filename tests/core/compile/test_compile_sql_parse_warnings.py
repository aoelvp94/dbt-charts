"""compile() surfaces SQL syntax errors, so editors can squiggle them.

Before this, a board with an unparseable query body compiled clean: the
compile-time guard caught the failure and dropped it into `logger.debug`, so
`dct validate` printed OK and VS Code's Problems panel stayed empty. The
author found out when the warehouse rejected the query.

The reason it stayed off is noise, so most of these tests are about what must
NOT warn. Two things gate the emission: the query's dialect has to be
resolvable from its source (BigQuery SQL parsed as generic SQL fails on ~40%
of real boards), and sqlglot has to hand back a position we can trust.
