"""Regression tests for the animation_duration deletion (DEV boundary).

``animation_duration`` was removed from all style models in the current
(unreleased) cycle.  ``versions/v0_7_0.py`` must register Deletions for every
position where the key appeared in the frozen 0.4.0 schema so that authored
boards from before the removal migrate cleanly.

Positions covered by the migration:
- style.charts.animation_duration  (ChartsStyle/ChartsStylePatch)
- style.charts.<family>.animation_duration  (per-family theme patches, 11 families)
- charts.<name>.style.animation_duration  (chart-level style, all families)
