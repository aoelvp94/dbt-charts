"""Floor guarantee for FontStyle fields on resolved table chart style.

The render layer previously used `field if field else <hardcoded>` ternaries on
FontStyle fields.  These are unreachable after a normal theme resolution because
_base.yaml guarantees font.size/weight and stark.yaml guarantees font.family for
every built-in theme.

These tests lock the invariant so the asserts that replaced the ternaries are safe.
The parameterized test covers every shipped theme so a regression in any single
theme YAML is caught immediately.
