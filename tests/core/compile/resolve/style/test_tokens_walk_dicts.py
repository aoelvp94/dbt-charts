"""The color-token walk must reach color-bearing dicts, not just models and lists.

`_resolve_color_tokens` recursed into BaseModel fields and list elements only.
Its docstring said why — "no color-bearing dicts exist on Style today; if one is
added it needs to be handled here explicitly" — and one was added since:
`TableChartStyle.columns` is `dict[str, TableColumnConfig]`, keyed by column
name, so every per-column color sat behind a dict the walk stopped at.

The raw token address then reached the render layer, which did three different
things with it depending on the slot — dropped it (background, font.color),
passed it through into the SVG (spark.color), or failed to parse it
(glyph_color). The first is why this survived: it leaves no trace to grep for,
so the assertions here compare against a render with no color authored at all.
