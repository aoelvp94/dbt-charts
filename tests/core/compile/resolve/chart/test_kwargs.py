"""Chart-local palette capacity vs board-wide category-color scales.

`_bound_scales` (`compile/resolve/chart/_kwargs.py`) narrows the board's
planned scales to the fields a chart draws. A scale is planned against the
BOARD palette, but a chart's own EFFECTIVE palette -- a chart-local
`style.color.categorical.palette` override, or a nested board's shorter theme
-- can be shorter. On `main`, a scale whose highest
slot exceeds that shorter palette is handed to the chart anyway, and the
chart's own render then raises `ChartDataError` out of `category_colors._slot_for` --
turning a board that rendered fine before this feature existed into an
error, just because a sibling chart happens to share the field. The fix is
to decline the binding for THAT chart instead: `_bound_scales` drops any
scale it cannot seat, and the chart keeps the per-chart coloring it had
before binding existed.
