"""Tests for the actionable error hint on chart-level style.legend for kpi/table charts.

kpi and table charts never paint a legend. The chart-level ``style.legend`` key
was removed in the current (unreleased) cycle. Unlike the theme-level
``style.charts.kpi.legend`` path (which is auto-stripped by ``dct migrate``),
the chart-level path cannot be expressed as a Deletion because the tail
``("style", "legend")`` is still valid for painting families. Instead, a clear
error with a removal hint is raised so authors know exactly what to do.
