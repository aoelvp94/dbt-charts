"""Pins VEGA_SCHEME_NAMES against the renderer this repo actually ships.

The frozenset is a hand-maintained list (vl-convert exposes no queryable
scheme enum at the Python API level), so this test is what keeps it honest:
every name must round-trip through vl-convert's bundled Vega-Lite → SVG
pipeline. A name that stops rendering, or a real scheme vl-convert accepts
but this set omits, should fail here — not surface as a compile-time
rejection of a previously-working board (see codes_compile.py's ERR-*
provenance and `dataface/AGENTS.md`'s "no hand-written parallel schema" rule).
