"""Guard: no builtin ``open()`` (or its close cousins) inside ``dbt_charts/core``.

`dbt_charts/core` reaches project content only through the `Project`/`ProjectPath`
ABC so an embedding host (Cloud's git-blob store) can back it with something
other than the local disk (see the "Project-file access goes through Project,
never raw Path" section of `core/AGENTS.md`). Ruff's `TID251` banned-api gate
(`core/ruff.toml`) statically forbids the `pathlib.Path`/`os`/`shutil`/`tempfile`
import forms of disk access, but it cannot ban the builtin `open()` — that's not
an import. This AST test closes that gap.

Every current real-FS `open()`/`.open()` call site is accepted debt, tracked
in `ALLOWED_OPEN` with a one-line reason. The allowlist is a ratchet: it must
equal the offender set exactly. Fixing a site means deleting its entry, not
widening the list.

`super().open(...)` is exempt in the detector itself rather than through that
ledger: it is a base-class dispatch that opens no file, and dbt's connection-
manager API happens to name its connect hook `open`. An entry in `ALLOWED_OPEN`
would misreport a non-offender as tracked debt.
