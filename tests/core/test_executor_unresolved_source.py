"""Regression test: unresolved string sources must surface as a clear error
through Executor.execute_query, not silently fall back to DuckDB.

Repro: Cloud's chart-preview path wraps the chart in a board whose `sources:`
block only contains an in-memory DuckDB. If the chart references a different
named source (e.g. `my_postgres`), pre-fix behavior was to run the SQL on
DuckDB anyway, surfacing as a misleading parser error (notably for backtick-
quoted BigQuery identifiers).
