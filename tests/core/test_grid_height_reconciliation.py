"""Grid height budget and grid height assignment must agree.

`_measure_grid_layout_height` decides how tall a grid band needs to be;
`_calculate_grid_dimensions` decides how tall each row actually is. Both answer
"how tall is this grid", so a grid can only lay out correctly when they compute
it the same way — items 16 and 33 of the render-layer gap register.
