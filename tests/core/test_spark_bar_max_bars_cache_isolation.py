"""Regression test: a spark_bar failure cached by chart id alone must not
poison a sibling placement of the same chart under a different resolved style.

``layout_sizing._require_resolved``'s ``resolve_errors`` cache is keyed by
chart id alone, on the documented assumption that resolve-time validation
never reads width or style. spark_bar's numeric check used to be an exception
to that: it read a cascaded style value (``style.spark_bar.max_bars``) to
decide which rows to validate. Two nested boards placing the SAME chart id
under two different ``max_bars`` values could then have the first placement's
failure poison the second, even though the second would have rendered fine on
its own.

Fixing the validator to read the full query result (not the max_bars slice)
makes the numeric verdict style-independent, which removes the poisoning
opportunity structurally: both placements now agree, so there is nothing for
one to wrongly cache onto the other.
