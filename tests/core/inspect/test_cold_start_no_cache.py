"""Regression: render_inspect_dashboard resolves schema_name from resolver, not cache.

Cold start = dbt project + DuckDB adapter, no target/super_schema.json.
Schema-shaped panels must render (column inventory appears in HTML) without
a cache file. The old implementation would fall through to schema_name=""
on cold start and miss the schema; the new implementation walks the resolver
to find the schema containing the model.
