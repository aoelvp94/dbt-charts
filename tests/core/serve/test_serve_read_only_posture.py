"""`dct serve` defaults to strict read-only (external DuckDB access off).

After the file source materializer landed, serve no longer needs SQL-level
``read_csv`` / ``read_json`` — file sources are parsed via PyArrow into the
result cache. So serve tightens to strict read-only, matching Cloud: author
SQL cannot reach the filesystem or network through DuckDB, yet ``files:``
sources still render because the materializer handles them out-of-band.
