"""Tests for cross-request adapter-registry persistence in dct serve.

The per-source connection pool (``SqlAdapter._source_pools``) lives on a
``SqlAdapter`` inside an ``AdapterRegistry``. ``dct serve`` builds one registry at
startup and keeps it warm on ``app.state.adapter_registry`` across requests — it is
rebuilt only when ``dbt_charts.yml`` changes (source config edits) and closed on
shutdown. So a repeat view reuses the already-open warehouse connections.
