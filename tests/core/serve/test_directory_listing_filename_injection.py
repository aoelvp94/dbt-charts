"""Regression test: a poisoned filename must not become Jinja template source.

``_render_directory_listing`` builds its listing markdown from on-disk
filenames, then splices that markdown into the packaged ``directory.yml``
board template. If that splice happens via a Jinja render, the *output* text
(now containing the filename verbatim) is handed to ``compile()``, and the
resulting ``board.text`` is Jinja-rendered a second time at display time
(``render/boards.py``'s markdown pass) -- evaluating whatever Jinja syntax the
filename happens to contain. A file whose name is a Jinja expression is then
executed with no board content authored at all.
