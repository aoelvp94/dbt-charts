"""`style.text.rule` owns markdown gridline/rule color; the table's border
override is gone.

``TableChartStyle`` declared its own ``border: BorderStyle`` ("Table outer
border style"), *shadowing* the chart-card border slot every other family
inherits from ``_ChartStyleBase``. The override was required-but-inert: the
table renderer read it into a ``colors["border"]`` key that was written twice
and never read, and the table's visible lines come from ``header.rule`` /
``row.rule`` instead. Its ``color`` escaped only into mdsvg as
``table_border_color`` / ``hr_color`` — the gridlines of *markdown* tables and
``<hr>``, never the table chart.

The override is removed (table now inherits the shared card slot like every
other family) and the markdown coupling is filed under the surface it paints.

TDD tests — written BEFORE the change.
