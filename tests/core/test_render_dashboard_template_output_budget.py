"""End-to-end: render_dashboard() opens the render-scoped template-output
budget around compile + execute + render, so an amplifying templated field
fails the whole board render with ERR-TEMPLATE-OUTPUT-TOO-LARGE instead of
exhausting memory.

Proves the real per-board-render entry point (not a hand-opened
template_output_budget() scope) — the seam Cloud's renders worker
(apps/cloud/apps/renders/tasks.py) and the CLI both go through. The
cumulative-across-different-call-sites property itself (many fields, each
individually under the ceiling, tripping it combined) is proven
deterministically at the unit level in test_output_budget.py, which drives
resolve_jinja_template()/render_parameterized() directly under one manually
opened scope — not repeated here through a chart query, whose execution
happens on the query executor's thread pool with its own caching and
per-chart error-isolation behavior, orthogonal to this bound.
