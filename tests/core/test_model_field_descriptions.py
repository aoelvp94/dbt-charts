"""Tests that key compiled and input models have Field(description=...) annotations.

Field descriptions enable:
- Better IDE autocomplete tooltips in JSON Schema
- AI understanding of field semantics
- Auto-generation of apps/docs/docs/reference/yaml-reference.md via `just gen-yaml-reference`

Design: denylist approach — assert all model fields have descriptions,
with explicit exemptions for fields intentionally left bare (e.g., private/internal
fields, fields inherited from abstract bases that can't be annotated here).

TDD: these tests were written before the descriptions were added and drove the
implementation. Any field added to these models without a description will now fail CI.
