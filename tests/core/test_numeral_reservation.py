"""Tests for the font-measured suffix reservation on ``font_measure``.

Lives there (not ``compile/``): the ruler consumer is compile-stage (ticks
are baked at resolve time) but the ledger consumer runs over query rows at
render time, and ``font_measure`` is the leaf both sides already import
directly.

Cases are derived from ``SharedScale`` itself (every tier x every mode)
rather than a hand-typed suffix table, so the test cannot pin a suffix
``_D3_TO_NARRATIVE`` never produces (the narrative-trillions suffix is
``"trn"``).

``compose_suffix_reservation`` replaced the earlier whole-digit-unit
``suffix_reservation_slots``: ``dbt Sans Tabular`` is tabular, not
monospace — only the ten digits and the minus sign share one fixed
advance, so a suffix like ``" K"`` (~1.45 digit-widths) is never an
integer number of digits wide, and no count of one-digit U+2007 FIGURE
SPACEs can express that without a visible residual (ceil overshoots by
more than half a digit; floor undershoots by nearly as much). Composing a
short run of the Unicode space vocabulary — each occupying a different,
measured fraction of a digit's advance — reaches sub-pixel error instead.
See "the reservation is exact in slots, approximate in width" in
``ai_notes/jul26-02-numeral-system-design.md`` (corrected 2026-08-06).
