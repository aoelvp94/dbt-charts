"""Render-level verification for the sub-day clock vocabulary's tick-cadence gate.

Pure-function coverage of ``default_subday_label_expr_for`` lives in
test_subday_clock_label_expr.py. These tests render a real chart through the
full pipeline and read the x-axis tick label TEXT Vega itself drew — proving
the gate's effect on what a viewer actually sees, not just on the labelExpr
string the function returns: the rendered ticks are the contract, not the
input data.
