"""TrivialDuckDBCache ingests rows in bulk via Arrow, not row-by-row.

The file-source cold path (and every result-cache write) funnels through
``TrivialDuckDBCache.put``. Loading via a per-row ``executemany`` is O(rows) of
Python round-trips (measured ~47s for 100k rows); registering a single Arrow
table and doing one bulk INSERT is ~100ms. These tests pin the bulk behavior and
that it preserves the existing value-type/JSON semantics.
