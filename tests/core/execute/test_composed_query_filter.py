"""Regression: a composed query ({{ queries.X }}) that also uses {{ filter(...) }}
must execute cleanly end-to-end instead of raising CompilationError.

Root cause: reference resolution used to render the fully-expanded composed SQL,
which bound the raising compile-time filter()/filter_date_range() stubs. A query
that both composed another query AND filtered hit that stub before the adapter's
parameterized pass ever got a chance to bind filter() safely — the same pass that
already handled filter() fine for non-composed queries.

Resolution is now reference expansion only, so a filter helper reaches that pass
as author-written text and binds there like any other.
