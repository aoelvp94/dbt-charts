"""Security regression: a composed query's variable values are data, not template.

A query holding ``{{ queries.X }}`` used to be rendered twice — once to expand the
reference and substitute variables, once again on the way to the warehouse. The
second render read the first render's output, so a variable value sat in template
position and was evaluated: ``{{ 7*7 }}`` arrived as ``49``, and a value naming a
Jinja global reached the interpreter's globals and ran a shell command on the
render host.

The same double pass inlined values as bare ``str(value)`` with no escaping, so a
composed query also lost the parameter binding that the identical SQL gets without
the reference.

Both follow from rendering twice, and both are covered here at the boundary that
matters: what reaches the warehouse.
