"""A closed registry must not still hold the DuckDB warehouse file open.

DuckDB treats ``enable_external_access`` as a database-instance option: every
connection to one file must agree on it, or the second opener gets
``Can't open a connection to same database file with a different configuration
than existing connections``.

The dbt path pinned the file past its owner's lifetime. dbt's connection pool
only *releases* a connection on ``connection_named`` exit, and dbt-duckdb hangs
the live handle off a process-global ``DuckDBConnectionManager._ENV`` — so a
schema query (auto-link issues one mid-render) left the warehouse open forever.
A later session with a different posture — e.g. an eval's render assertion at
the default read-only posture after the solver ran under
``LOCAL_AUTHORING_REGISTRY_KWARGS`` — could then not connect at all, which is
how ``render`` failed non-deterministically in the dundersign_chat suite.
