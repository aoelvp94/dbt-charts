"""`dbt_utils.py` against a real dbt v2-emitted manifest.json.

`dbt-charts/tests/fixtures/fusion_manifest/manifest.json` was produced by
`dbt parse` with `dbt-fusion 2.0.0-preview.193` against the `jaffle-shop`
jaffle project (Snowflake target), with the `macros` key stripped (unused
by any dbt charts reader — it was 828KB of the 934KB raw file). Every other
key is byte-for-byte what dbt v2 wrote.

The highest-risk field per that inventory is `relation_name` — a
dbt v1-computed convenience string. These tests confirm dbt v2 emits it
(`DATABASE.schema.alias`, same shape as dbt v1) so ref resolution
resolves `ref()`/`source()` calls without falling back to composing
`schema.alias` itself.

# A second real dbt v2 fixture, from the same jaffle_shop project built with a
# DuckDB target instead of Snowflake, diffed key-for-key against a dbt v1
# 1.12.0 manifest from the identical project (see the task worksheet's
# divergence table). `relation_name` differs in shape by *adapter*, not by
# engine: dbt v1 emits the 3-part `"memory"."main"."customers"` (DuckDB's
# in-memory default database name baked in); dbt v2 emits the 2-part
# `"main"."customers"` — no database segment. Both are still present (the
# highest-risk field from the inventory), just quoted/segmented differently.
# dbt charts' own DuckDB adapter always connects directly to one resolved
# file/`:memory:` context (`_resolved_path` in duckdb_adapter.py) rather than
# ATTACHing multiple databases by name, so a schema-qualified 2-part
# reference is unambiguous and correct here — not a bug to fix.
