"""Regression tests: source-resolver errors must survive `to_diagnostic()`.

The resolver's raise sites feed `available=` into a code whose
`hint_generator` splits it as a comma-separated string. Passing a raw `list`
crashed inside `build_diagnostic` — after the error was already raised, so the
`except DbtChartsError` handlers that call `to_diagnostic()` (board_to_dict,
the LSP server) took an AttributeError instead of reporting the real problem.
The same raw list also leaked Python list repr into the user-facing message.
