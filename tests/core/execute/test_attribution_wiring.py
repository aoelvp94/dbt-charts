"""The execute boundary establishes attribution for each query it runs.

`test_attribution.py` covers the module in isolation; this pins the seam where it
meets the engine — the scope `AdapterRegistry.execute` opens around the adapter call,
including the case the pool-sharing design depends on: two sources with identical
connection identity but different `attribution:` must each get their own labels.
