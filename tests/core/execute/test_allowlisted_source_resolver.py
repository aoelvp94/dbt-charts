"""Unit tests for AllowlistedSourceResolver.

Pins the closed-allowlist resolver's three rejection rules (inline dict,
cross-file `#`, unknown name with sorted allowed list), board-level inline
rejection, the disabled dbt-context fallback, that the structured-error
payload does not echo connection-parameter values, and delegation of accepted
inputs to DefaultSourceResolver's shared lookup.
