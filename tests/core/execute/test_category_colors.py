"""Board-wide category-color planning: an empty result set must not poison a field.

`plan_board_category_colors`/`_observe`
(`execute/category_colors.py`) poison a field board-wide when a chart that
encodes it draws values `_observe` cannot use for a scale — non-string,
unanimously date-like. An empty result set took the same branch
(``if disqualified or not values: continue``), even though a chart with zero
rows cannot be mis-seated by anything — there is nothing to seat. That
contradicts the poisoning rationale itself ("a scale that cannot seat THIS
chart's values") and `_observe`'s own docstring ("Nulls are skipped, not
disqualifying"): under `dct serve`, a variable change that empties one
chart's result set silently drops the shared binding for every OTHER chart
on the board.
