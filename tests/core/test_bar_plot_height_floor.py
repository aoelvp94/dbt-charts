"""Integration: a narrow bar card's starved plot is measured, not mutated.

Real ``resolve()`` calls on a ``BarChart`` — see
``tests/core/compile/resolve/chart/test_plot_height_floor.py`` for the pure
``estimate_plot_height`` unit tests this wires
up, ``tests/render/warnings/test_plot_height_below_minimum.py`` for the
``WARN-PLOT-HEIGHT-BELOW-MINIMUM`` detector that reads the fields asserted
here, and ``ChartRenderingConfig.BarConfig`` (compile/models/config.py) for
the calibration sweep behind the constants.

No authored chrome is ever removed: this only asserts the resolved
