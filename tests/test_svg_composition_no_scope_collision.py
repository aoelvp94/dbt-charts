"""Standing guard: two boards on different themes must not collide when their
SVGs land in one HTML document (the docs themes page, or any Cloud surface
stacking more than one board — review diffs, merge conflicts, chat embeds).

Inline SVG in an HTML page has no style scope: every CSS rule a board's SVG
emits is document-global, so the last rule for a selector wins for every board
on the page. That is the general form of the bug fixed here one emitter at a
time — ``.md-heading`` in mdsvg, ``.dbt-table-row-link:hover`` in table.py.
Identical duplicates (constant rules, ``@font-face``) are fine; two byte-equal
rules cannot conflict.

Scope: CSS selectors only. Element ids are the other document-global namespace
and have the same defect; their guard lives in
``test_svg_composition_no_id_collision.py``, which renders in separate
subprocesses because an in-process assertion would pass vacuously (vl-convert's
id counter keeps advancing across renders in one process).
