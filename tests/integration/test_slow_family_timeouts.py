"""Regression: slow test families must override the repo-wide 30s timeout.

`timeout = 30` in root pyproject.toml kills tests that legitimately run
longer on a loaded machine (wheel build + venv install). Those families
carry a module-level `pytest.mark.timeout` override; this test protects
that override from being silently dropped.
