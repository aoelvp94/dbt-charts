"""Behavioral pinning tests for table-emphasis.yml.

These tests load the specimen board and render specific charts to SVG,
asserting the distinctions that prove emphasis wiring fired correctly.
We pin specific cell fills or text colors that differ under the two
possible code paths (correct vs broken), so each test fails when the
relevant production guard is reverted.

Test structure:
  - M2a: diverging auto-hinge — Focal Point Inc (-0.081) gets diverging fill
    (#d29fb2), not sequential fill (#bd7391). Fails if resolve_hinge stubbed.
  - M3b: Apex (positive growth) has non-red growth text; Cascade (negative) has red.
    Fails if the lt:0 predicate is inverted.
  - M4a: tiered threshold — narrow-range cells get narrow-range color (rule order).
  - M6a: scale on quarterly_revenue — total row (193.52M) does NOT get its
    expected fill (#00481d). Fails if the is_summary_role guard is removed.
  - M6b: when-rules fire on value rows; total row (empty growth_rate) is uncolored.
